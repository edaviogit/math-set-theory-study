∀⃗a ∈Rn F(⃗a) < G(⃗a) iﬀ∀⃗a ∈(∗R)n ∗F(⃗a) < ∗G(⃗a). Exercise 29. Prove the above theorem. This includes verifying that ∗F is a function. As a consequence of this theorem, we can extend + and × to ∗R. For example, a + b = c means that ∃f ∈a ∃g ∈b ∃h ∈c {n ∈ω : f(n) + g(n) = h(n)} ∈U. 71 Indeed, the natural embedding embeds R as an ordered subﬁeld of ∗R. In order to do elementary calculus we consider the inﬁnitesimal elements of ∗R. Note that R ̸= ∗R; consider α = [⟨1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . , 1/n, . . . ⟩]. Then α > 0 but α < r for each positive r ∈R; a member of ∗R with this property is called a positive inﬁnitesimal. There are negative inﬁnitesimals; 0 is an inﬁnitesimal. Since ∗R is a ﬁeld 1/α exists and 1/α > r for any real number r; it is an example of a positive inﬁnite number. A hyperreal number a is said to be ﬁnite whenever lal < r for some real r. Two hyperreal numbers a and b are said to be inﬁnitely close whenever a −b is inﬁnitesimal. We write a ≈b. Lemma. Each ﬁnite hyperreal number is inﬁnitely close to a unique real number. Proof. Let a be ﬁnite. Let s = sup {r ∈R : r < a}. Then a ≈s. If we also have another real t such that a ≈t, then we have s ≈t and so s = t. If a is ﬁnite, the standard part of a, st(a), is deﬁned to be the unique real number which is inﬁnitely close to a. It is easy to check that for ﬁnite a and b, st(a + b) = st(a) + st(b); and, st(a × b) = st(a) × st(b). For a function F : R →R we deﬁne the derivative, F ′(x), of F(x) to be st F(x + △x) −F(x) △x  provided this exists and is the same for each non-zero inﬁnitesimal △x. 72CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS The fact that F ′(x) exists implies that for each inﬁnitesimal △x there is an inﬁnitesimal ϵ such that F(x + △x) = F(x) + F ′(x)△x + ϵ△x. That is, for any △x ≈0 there is some ϵ ≈0 such that △y = F ′(x)△x + ϵ△x where △y = F(x + △x) −F(x). Theorem 32. (The Chain Rule) Suppose y = F(x) and x = G(t) are diﬀerentiable functions. Then y = F(G(t)) is diﬀerentiable and has derivative F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Proof. Let △t be any non-zero inﬁnitesimal. Let △x = G(t + △t) −G(t). Since G′(x) exists, △x is inﬁnitesimal. Let △y = F(x + △x) −F(x). We wish to calculate st( △y △x), which will be the derivative of y = F(G(t)). We consider two cases. Case 0: △x = 0 △y = 0, st(△y △t ) = 0, and G′(t) = st(△x △t ) = 0. So st(△y △t ) = F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Case 1: △x ̸= 0 △y △t = △y △x · △x △t . So st(△y △t ) = st( △y △x) · st(△x △t ), and again, st(△y △t ) = F ′(x) · G′(t) = F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Chapter 9 The Universe In this chapter we shall discuss two methods of measuring the complexity of a set, as well as their corresponding gradations of the universe. For this discussion it will be helpful to develop both a new induction and a new recursion procedure, this time on the whole universe. Each of these will depend upon the fact that every set is contained in a transitive set, which we now prove. By recursion on N, we deﬁne: [ 0X = X; and, [ n+1X = [ ( [ nX). We deﬁne the transitive closure of X as, trcl(X) = [ { [ nX : n ∈ω}. Theorem 33. 1. ∀X trcl(X) is the smallest transitive set containing X. 2. ∀x trcl(x) = x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}. Proof. Note that Y is transitive iﬀS Y ⊆Y , so trcl(X) is transitive. 73 74 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE 1. If Y is transitive and X ⊆Y then for each n ∈N, S nX ⊆S nY ⊆Y . So trcl(X) ⊆Y . 2. To prove that trcl(x) ⊇x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}, notice ﬁrst that since ∀y ∈x y ⊆S x, we have that ∀n ∈ω S ny ⊆S n+1x. Hence trcl(y) ⊆trcl(x). For the opposite containment, we prove by induction that ∀n ∈ω S nx ⊆x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}. As with N and ON, we can perform induction on the universe, called ∈−induction, as illustrated by the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 34. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. We shall assume that the theorem is false and derive a contradiction. We have ⃗w and a ﬁxed l such that ¬Φ(l, ⃗w).
