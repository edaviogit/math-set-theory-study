⟩↔(u = x ∧v = y)]. Exercise 1. Prove parts (4) and (5) of Theorem 1 We now assert the existence of unions and intersections. No doubt the reader has experienced a symmetry between these two concepts. Here how- ever, while the Union Axiom is used extensively, the Intersection Axiom is redundant and is omitted in most developments of the subject. We include it here because it has some educational value (see Exercise 4). The Union Axiom ∀x [x ̸= ∅→∃z z = {w : (∃y ∈x)(w ∈y)}] The class {w : (∃y ∈x)(w ∈y)} is abbreviated as S x and called the “big union”. The Intersection Axiom ∀x [x ̸= ∅→∃z z = {w : (∀y ∈x)(w ∈y)}] The class {w : (∀y ∈x)(w ∈y)} is abbreviated as T x and called the “big intersection”. The Axiom of Foundation ∀x [x ̸= ∅→(∃y ∈x)(x ∩y = ∅)] This axiom, while it may be “obviously true”, is not certainly obvious. Let’s investigate what it says: suppose there were a non-empty x such that (∀y ∈x) (x ∩y ̸= ∅). For any z1 ∈x we would be able to get z2 ∈z1 ∩x. Since z2 ∈x we would be able to get z3 ∈z2 ∩x. The process continues forever: · · · ∈z4 ∈z3 ∈z2 ∈z1 ∈x 25 We wish to rule out such an inﬁnite regress. We want our sets to be founded: each such sequence should eventually end with the empty set. Hence the name of the axiom, which is also known as the Axiom of Regularity. It is nevertheless best understood by its consequences. Theorem 2. 1. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x ∪y. 2. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x ∩y. 3. ∀x ∀y x ∈y →y /∈x. 4. ∀x x /∈x. Exercise 2. Prove Theorem 2. Let f(x) denote the class S{y : ⟨x, y⟩∈f}. Exercise 3. Suppose f is a function and x ∈dom(f). Prove that ⟨x, y⟩∈f iﬀy = f(x). Suppose that x is a set and that there is some way of removing each element u ∈x and replacing u with some element v. Would the result be a set. Well, of course—provided there are no tricks here. That is, there should be a well deﬁned replacement procedure which ensures that each u is replaced by only one v. This well deﬁned procedure should be described by a formula, Φ, in the language of set theory. We can guarantee that each u is replaced by exactly one v by insisting that ∀u ∈x ∃!v Φ(x, u, v). We would like to obtain an axiom, written in the language of set theory stating that for each set x and each such formula Φ we get a set z. However, this is impossible. We cannot express “for each formula” in the language of set theory—in fact this formal language was designed for the express purpose of avoiding such expressions which bring us perilously close to Richard’s Paradox. The answer to this conundrum is to utilise not just one axiom, but in- ﬁnitely many—one axiom for each formula of the language of set theory. Such a system is called an axiom scheme. 26 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY The Replacement Axiom Scheme For each formula Φ(x, u, v, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory, we have the axiom: ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x [∀u ∈x ∃!v Φ →∃z z = {v : ∃u ∈x Φ}] Note that we have allowed Φ to have w1, . . . , wn as parameters, that is, free variables which may be used to specify various procedures in various contexts within a mathematical proof. This is illustrated by the following theorem. Theorem 3. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x × y. Proof. From Theorem 1 parts (4) and (5), for all t ∈y we get ∀u ∈x ∃!v v = ⟨u, t⟩. We now use Replacement with the formula “Φ(x, u, v, t)” as “v = ⟨u, t⟩”; t is a parameter. We obtain, for each t ∈y: ∃q q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}. By Extensionality, in fact ∀t ∈y ∃!q q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}. We again use Replacement, this time with the formula Φ(y, t, q, x) as “q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}”; here x is a parameter. We obtain: ∃r r = {q : ∃t ∈y q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}} By the Union Axiom ∃z z = S r and so we have: z = {p : ∃q [q ∈r ∧p ∈q]} = {p : ∃q [(∃t ∈y) q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩} ∧p ∈q]} = {p : (∃t ∈y)(∃q)[q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩} ∧p ∈q]} = {p : (∃t ∈y)p ∈{v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}} = {p : (∃t ∈y)(∃u ∈x) p = ⟨u, t⟩} = x × y 27 Exercise 4. Show that the Intersection Axiom is indeed redundant.
