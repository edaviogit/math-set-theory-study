hird implications accrue from Φ(⃗w) being △T 1 ; the second from the fact that Ψ is △0 and M is transitive and models the axioms of T. This is often used with T as ZFC without Power Set and M = H(κ). Chapter 11 Elementary Submodels In this chapter we shall ﬁrst introduce a collection of set operations proposed by Kurt G¨odel which are used to build sets. We shall then discuss the new concept of elementary submodel. We now deﬁne the ordered n−tuple with the following inﬁnitely many formulas, thereby extending the notion of ordered pair. ⟨x⟩= x ⟨x, y⟩= {{x}, {x, y}} ⟨x, y, z⟩= ⟨⟨x, y⟩, z⟩ ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩= ⟨⟨x1, . . . , xn−1⟩, xn⟩ The following operations shuﬄe the components of such tuples in a set S. F0(S) = {⟨⟨u, v⟩, w⟩: ⟨u, ⟨v, w⟩⟩∈S} F1(S) = {⟨u, ⟨v, w⟩⟩: ⟨⟨u, v⟩, w⟩∈S} F2(S) = {⟨v, u⟩: ⟨u, v⟩∈S} F3(S) = {⟨v, u, w⟩: ⟨u, v, w⟩∈S} F4(S) = {⟨t, v, u, w⟩: ⟨t, u, v, w⟩∈S} Lemma. (Shuﬄe Lemma Scheme) 89 90 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS For any m ∈N and any permutation σ: m →m, there is a composition of the operations F0, F1, F2, F3, F4 such that for any S, Fσ(S) = {⟨xσ(0), . . . , xσ(m−1)⟩: ⟨x0, . . . , xm−1⟩∈S}. Proof. Since binary exchanges generate the symmetric group, noting that the identity permutation is given by F2 ◦F2, it suﬃces to consider only σ such that for some l ≤m, σ(i) =      i + 1, if i = l; i −1, if i = l + 1; i, otherwise. For convenience, let F n i denote the n−fold composition of Fi. There are several cases. Case 1: m = 2 Fσ = F2 Case 2: m = 3, l = 1 Fσ = F3 Case 3: m = 3, l = 2 Fσ = F0 ◦F2 ◦F3 ◦F2 ◦F1 Case 4: m ≥4, l = 1 Fσ = F m−3 0 ◦F3 ◦F m−3 1 Case 5: m ≥4, 1 ≤l ≤m −1 Fσ = F m−l−2 0 ◦F4 ◦F m−l−2 1 Case 6: m ≥4, l = m −1 Fσ = F0 ◦F2 ◦F3 ◦F2 ◦F1 The G¨odel Operations are as follows: 91 G1(X, Y ) = {X, Y } G2(X, Y ) = X \ Y G3(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y }; i.e., X × Y G4(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧u = v} G5(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧u ∈v} G6(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧v ∈u} G7(X, R) = {u : ∃x ∈X ⟨u, x⟩∈R} G8(X, R) = {u : ∀x ∈X ⟨u, x⟩∈R} G9(X, R) = F0(R) G10(X, R) = F1(R) G11(X, R) = F2(R) G12(X, R) = F3(R) G13(X, R) = F4(R) G9 through G13 are deﬁned as binary operations for conformity. We now construct a function which, when coupled with recursion on ON, will enumerate all possible compositions of G¨odel operations. G: N×V →V is given by the following rule. For each k ∈ω and each ⃗s: k →V, we deﬁne GlN×⃗s by recursion on N as follows: G(n,⃗s) =      ⃗s(i), if n = 17i, 0 ≤i ≤k; Gm(G(i,⃗s), G(j,⃗s)), if n = m · 19i+123j+1, 1 ≤m ≤13; ∅, otherwise. — Now G enumerates all compositions of G¨odel operations. We wish to prove that sets deﬁned by △0 formulas can be obtained through a composition of G¨odel operations. First we need a lemma. Lemma. Each of the following sets is equal to a composition of G¨odel oper- ations on X, ⃗w. 92 CHAPTER 11.

First note that {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X} = G3(G3 . . . (G3(X, X), . . . X), X) where G3 is composed (m −1)−fold; i.e., (. . . ((X × X) × X) × · · · × X). Now call this set Pm(X), the mth power of X. Let us now examine each of the seven cases individually. 1. This is either Pm(X) or ∅depending upon whether or not wi = wj. 2. This is either Pm(X) or ∅depending upon whether or not wi ∈wj. 3. If m = 1, then this set is ⟨wi⟩= wi. For m > 1, we may, thanks to the Shuﬄe Lemma, without loss of generality assume that j = m. The set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), wi) if wi ∈X and ∅otherwise. 4. Again, without loss of generality, we assume j = m. This set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), G7(X, G6(X, {wi}))). 5. Again, assume j = m.
