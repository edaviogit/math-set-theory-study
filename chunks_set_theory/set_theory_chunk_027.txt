k) ⇔H(θ) l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) by elementarity, ⇔Φ(y0, . . . , yk) since H(θ) is transitive. 97 Remark. The same is true for △T 1 formulas where T is ZFC without Power Set. For any formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk) of LOST, we have: Lemma. Φ ∀y0 ∈M ∀y2 ∈M . . . ∀yk ∈M ∀x ∈H(θ) [H(θ) l= z = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} →z ∈M]. Proof. Let y0, . . . , yk ∈M and z ∈H(θ) be given such that H(θ) l= z = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)}. Then, H(θ) l= ∃u u = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒M l= ∃u u = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒∃p ∈M [M l= p = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)}] ⇒H(θ) l= p = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒H(θ) l= p = z. H(θ) is transitive; therefore, p = z and hence z ∈M. Corollaries. 1. If M ≺H(θ), then (a) ∅∈M; (b) ω ∈M; and, (c) ω ⊆M. 2. If also θ > ω1, then ω1 ∈M. Proof. ∅and ω are direct. For ω ⊆M show that y ∈M ⇒y ∪{y} ∈M. 98 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Lemma. Suppose M ≺H(θ) where θ is regular and uncountable. Suppose p is countable and p ∈M. Then p ⊆M. Proof. Let q ∈p; we must show that q ∈M. Let f0 : ω →p be a surjection. Since {ω, p} ⊂H(θ) we must have f0 ∈H(θ). Since the formula “f : ω → p and p is surjective” is a △0 formula and {f0, ω, p} ⊂H(θ), we have H(θ) l= (f0 : ω →p and p is surjective). So H(θ) l= (∃f)(f : ω →and p is surjective). Since {ω, p} ⊂M we have, M l= (∃f)(f : ω →p and p is surjective). That is, (∃fp ∈M)(fp : ω →p and p is surjective). Pick n ∈ω such that fp(n) = q, and again use the ﬁrst lemma as follows. Since {p, fp, n} ⊂M and (∃!x)(x ∈p and fp(n) = x) is a △0 formula M l= (∃!x)(x ∈p and fp(n) = x). That is, (∃!x)(x ∈p ∩M and fp(n) = x). Since x is unique, x = q and thus q ∈M. Corollary. ω1 ∩M ∈ω1. Proof. It is enough to show that ω1 ∩M is a countable initial segment of ω1. If α ∈ω1 ∩M, then by the above lemma, α ⊆M. Proof of Pressing Down Lemma Let M ≺H(ω2) such that M is countable and f ∈M. Let δ = ω1 ∩M and let β = f(δ) < δ. Then, (∀α < δ)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(x) = β]. 99 So ∀α < δ H(ω2) l= (∃x ∈ω1)(x > α ∧f(x) = β), since everything relevant is in H(ω2). Hence, ∀α < δ M l= (∃x ∈ω1)(x > α ∧f(α) = β) since {α, β, ω1, f} ⊂M. Now, since δ = ω1 ∩M we have, M l= (∀α ∈ω1)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(α) = β]. So H(ω2) l= (∀α ∈ω1)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(α) = β]. Thus we have H(ω2) l= f ←{β} is uncountable. Again, since everything relevant is in H(ω2) we conclude that f ←{β} is uncountable. 2 Proof of the Delta System Lemma Let A be as given. We may, without loss of generosity, let A = {a(α) : α < ω1} where a: ω1 →V. We may also assume that a: ω1 →P(ω1). Let M be countable with {A, ⊣} ⊆M and M ≺H(ω2). Let δ = ω1 ∩M. Let R = a(δ) ∩δ. Since R ⊆M, we know R ∈M by the second lemma. So, ∀α < δ ∃β > α a(β) ∩β = R ⇒H(ω2) l= (∀α < δ)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R] ⇒(∀α < δ) [H(ω2) l= (∃β > α)(a(β) ∩β = R)] ⇒(∀α < δ) [M l= (∃β > α)(a(β) ∩β = R)] ⇒M l= (∀α < ω1)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R] ⇒(∀α < ω1)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R]. Now recursively deﬁne D: ω1 →A as follows: D(α) = a(0); D(γ) = a(β) 100 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS where β is the least ordinal such that β > sup {D(γ) : γ < α} and a(β) ∩β = R. Now if γ1 < γ2 < ω1, then D(γ1) ⊆γ2. So, R ⊆D(γ1) ∩D(γ2) ⊆γ2 ∩D(γ2) = R. Thus we let D = {D(α) : α < ω1}. 2 Theorem 49. (Elementary Chain Theorem) Suppose that δ is a limit ordinal and {Mα : α < δ} is a set of elementary submodels of H(θ) such that ∀α ∀α′ (α < α′ < δ →Mα ⊂Mα′). Let Mδ = [ {Mα : α < δ}. Then Mδ ≺H(θ). Proof. Let k ∈ω, let ⃗y ∈ kMδ, and let n ∈ω. We need to show that G(n, H(θ), ⃗y) ∩H(θ) ̸= ∅⇒G(n, H(θ), ⃗y) ∩Mδ ̸= ∅. But this is easy since ⃗y ∈ kMα for some α < δ. Chapter 12 Constructibility The G¨odel closure of a set X is denoted by cl(X) = {X ∩G(n, ⃗y) : n ∈ω and ∃k ∈ω ⃗y ∈ k(X)}. The constructible sets are obtained by ﬁrst deﬁning a function L: ON →V by recursion as follows: L(0) = ∅ L(α + 1) = cl(L(α) ∪{L(α)}) L(δ) = [ {L(α) : α < δ} for a limit ordinal δ We denote by L the class S{L(α) : α ∈ON}. Sets in L are said to be constructible. Lemma. For each ordinal α, L(α) ⊆R(α). Proof. This is proved by induction.
