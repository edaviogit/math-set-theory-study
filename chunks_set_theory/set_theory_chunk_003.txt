Φ, then so are Θ and Ψ; 7. If (∀vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ and vi is a variable, then Ψ is a subformula of Φ; and, 8. If (∃vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ and vi is a variable, then Ψ is a subformula of Φ. Note that the subformulas of Φ are those formulas used in the construction of Φ. To say that a variable vi occurs bound in a formula Φ means one of the following two conditions holds: 1. For some subformula Ψ of Φ, (∀vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ; or, 2. For some subformula Ψ of Φ, (∃vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ. The result, Φ∗, of substituting the variable vj for each bound occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ is deﬁned by constructing a Ψ∗for each subformula Ψ of Φ as follows: 1. If Ψ is atomic, then Ψ∗is Ψ; 2. If Ψ is (¬Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (¬Θ∗); 3. If Ψ is (Γ ∧Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗∧Θ∗); 4. If Ψ is (Γ ∨Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗∨Θ∗); 5. If Ψ is (Γ →Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗→Θ∗); 6. If Ψ is (Γ ↔Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗↔Θ∗); 7. If Ψ is (∀vk)Θ for some formula Θ then Ψ∗is just (∀vk)Θ∗if k ̸= i, but if k = i then Ψ∗is (∀vj)Γ where Γ is the result of substituting vj for each occurrence of vi in Θ; and, 14 CHAPTER 1. LOST 8. If Ψ is (∃vk)Θ for some formula Θ then Ψ∗is just (∃vk)Θ∗if k ̸= i, but if k = i then Ψ∗is (∃vj)Γ where Γ is the result of substituting vj for each occurrence of vi in Θ. That a variable vi occurs free in a formula Φ means that at least one of the following is true: 1. Φ is an atomic formula and vi occurs in Φ; 2. Φ is (¬Ψ), Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ; 3. (Θ ∧Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 4. Φ is (Θ ∨Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 5. Φ is (Θ →Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 6. Φ is (Θ ↔Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 7. Φ is (∀vj)Ψ and Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ and i ̸= j; or, 8. Φ is (∃vj)Ψ and Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ and i ̸= j. As in the example below, a variable can occur both free and bound in a formula. However, notice that if a variable occurs in a formula at all it must occur either free, or bound, or both (but not at the same occurrence). We deﬁne the important notion of the substitution of a variable vj for each free occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ. This procedure is as follows. 1. Substitute a new variable vl for all bound occurrences of vi in Φ. 2. Substitute another new variable vk for all bound occurrences of vj in the result of (1). 15 3. Directly substitute vj for each occurrence of vi in the result of (2). Example. Let us substitute v2 for all free occurrences of v1 in the formula ((∀v1)((v1 = v2) →(v1 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) The steps are as follows. 1. ((∀v1)((v1 = v2) →(v1 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) 2. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) 3. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v4)(v4 ∈v1)) 4. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v4)(v4 ∈v2)) For the reader who is new to this abstract game of formal logic, step (2) in the substitution proceedure may appear to be unnecessary. It is indeed necessary, but the reason is not obvious until we look again at the example to see what would happen if step (2) were omitted. This step essentially changes (∃v2)(v2 ∈v1) to (∃v4)(v4 ∈v1). We can agree that each of these means the same thing, namely, “v1 is non-empty”. However, when v2 is directly substituted into each we get something diﬀerent: (∃v2)(v2 ∈v2) and (∃v4)(v4 ∈v2). The latter says that “v2 is non-empty” and this is, of course what we would hope would be the result of substituting v2 for v1 in “v1 is non-empty”. But the former statement, (∃v2)(v2 ∈v2), seems quite diﬀerent, making the strange assertion that “v2 is an element of itself”, and this is not what we have in mind. What caused this problem. An occurrence of the variable v2 became bound as a result of being substituted for v1. We will not allow this to happen.
