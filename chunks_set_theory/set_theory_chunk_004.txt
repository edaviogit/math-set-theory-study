nt of itself”, and this is not what we have in mind. What caused this problem. An occurrence of the variable v2 became bound as a result of being substituted for v1. We will not allow this to happen. When we substitute v2 for the free v1 we must ensure that this freedom is preserved for v2. For a formula Φ and variables vi and vj, let Φ(vilvj) denote the formula which results from substituting vj for each free occurance of vi. In order to make Φ(vilvj) well deﬁned, we insist that in steps (1) and (2) of the substitution process, the ﬁrst new variable available is used. Of course, the use of any other new variable gives an equivalent formula. In the example, if Φ is the formula on the ﬁrst line, then Φ(v1lv2) is the formula on the fourth line. 16 CHAPTER 1. LOST As a simple application we can show how to express “there exists a unique element”. For any formula Φ of the language of set theory we denote by (∃!vj)Φ the formula ((∃vj)Φ ∧(∀vj)(∀vl)((Φ ∧Φ(vjlvl)) →(vj = vl))) where vl is the ﬁrst available variable which does not occur in Φ. The ex- pression (∃!vj) can be considered as an abbreviation in the language of set theory, that is, an expression which is not actually part of the language. However, whenever we have a formula containing this expression, we can quickly convert it to a proper formula of the language of set theory. A class is just a string of symbols of the form {vi : Φ} where vi is a variable and Φ is a formula. Two important and well-known examples are: {v0 : (¬(v0 = v0))} which is called the empty set and is usually denoted by ∅, and {v0 : (v0 = v0)} which is called the universe and is usually denoted by V. A term is deﬁned to be either a class or a variable. Terms are the names for what the language of set theory talks about. A grammatical analogy is that terms correspond to nouns and pronouns—classes to nouns and variables to pronouns. Continuing the analogy, the predicates, or verbs, are = and ∈. The atomic formulas are the basic relationships among the predicates and the variables. We can incorporate classes into the language of set theory by showing how the predicates relate to them. Let Ψ and Θ be formulas of the language of set theory and let vj, vk and vl be variables. We write: vk ∈{vj : Ψ} instead of Ψ(vjlvk) vk = {vj : Ψ} instead of (∀vl)((vl ∈vk) ↔Ψ(vjlvl)) {vj : Ψ} = vk instead of (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔(vl ∈vk)) {vj : Ψ} = {vk : Θ} instead of (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔Θ(vklvl)) {vj : Ψ} ∈vk instead of (∃vl)((vl ∈vk) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) {vj : Ψ} ∈{vk : Θ} instead of (∃vl)(Θ(vklvl) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) 17 whenever vl is neither vj nor vk and occurs in neither Ψ nor Θ. We can now show how to express, as a proper formula of set theory, the substitution of a term t for each free occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ. We denote the resulting formula of set theory by Φ(vilt). The case when t is a variable vj has already been discussed. Now we tum our attention to the case when t is a class {vj : Ψ} and carry out a proceedure similar to the variable case. 1. Substitute the ﬁrst available new variable for all bound occurrences of vi in Φ. 2. In the result of (1), substitute, in tum, the ﬁrst available new variable for all bound occurrences of each variable which occurs free in Ψ. 3. In the result of (2), directly substitute {vj : Ψ} for vi into each atomic subformula in tum, using the table above. For example, the atomic subformula (vi ∈vk) is replaced by the new subfor- mula (∃vl)((vl ∈vk) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) where vl is the ﬁrst available new variable. Likewise, the atomic subformula (vi = vi) is replaced by the new subformula (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔Ψ(vjlvl)) where vl is the ﬁrst available new variable (although it is not important to change from vj to vl in this particular instance). 18 CHAPTER 1. LOST Chapter 2 FOUND The language of set theory is very precise, but it is extremely diﬃcult for us to read mathematical formulas in that language. We need to ﬁnd a way to make these formulas more intelligible.
