heorem 34. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. We shall assume that the theorem is false and derive a contradiction. We have ⃗w and a ﬁxed l such that ¬Φ(l, ⃗w). Let t be any transitive set containing l. Thanks to the previous theorem, we can let t = trcl(l ∪{l}). The proof now proceeds verbatim as the proofs of Theorems 8 and 13. We can also carry out recursive deﬁnitions on V; this is called ∈−recursion. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, V) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n)(∃f) [f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. ∈−recursion is justiﬁed by the next theorem scheme. 75 For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 35. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x)(∀f) [(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, V), we have: 1. F : V →V; 2. ∀x Φ(x, Flx, F(x), ⃗w); and furthermore for any n and any function H with n ∈dom(H) we have, 3. Φ(x, Hlx, H(x), ⃗w) for all x ∈n ∪{n} then H(n) = F(n). Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorems 9 and 14. Our ﬁrst new measure of the size of a set is given by the rank function. This associates, to each set x, an ordinal rank(x) by the following rule: rank(x) = sup {rank(y) + 1 : y ∈x} Observe that ∀α ∈ON rank(α) = α. By recursion on ON we deﬁne the cumulative hierarchy, an ordinal-gradation on V, as follows. R(0) = ∅; R(α + 1) = P(R(α)); and, R(δ) = [ {R(α) : α < δ} if δ is a limit ordinal. Sometimes we write Rα or Vα for R(α). The next theorem connects and lists some useful properties of the cumulative hierarchy and the rank function. Theorem 36. 76 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE 1. ∀α ∈ON R(α) is transitive. 2. ∀α ∈ON ∀β ∈ON (β < α →R(β) ⊆R(α). 3. ∀x ∀α ∈ON (x ∈R(α) ↔∃β ∈α x ⊆R(β)). 4. ∀x ∀α ∈ON (x ∈R(α + 1) \ R(α) ↔rank(x) = α). 5. ∀x ∃α ∈ON x ∈R(α); i.e., V = S{R(α) : α ∈ON}. Proof. 1. This is an easy induction on α ∈ON. 2. Apply induction on α, using (1). 3. (→) Note that if γ is least ordinal such that x ∈R(γ), then γ is a successor ordinal, so choose β such that γ = β + 1; (←) This uses (2). 4. First show by induction on α that rank(x) < α implies x ∈R(α). 5. This follows from ∀x ∃α ∈ON rank(x) = α. We have discussed cardinality as a way of measuring the size of a set. However, if our set is not transitive, the cardinality function does not tell the whole story since it cannot distinguish the elements of the set. For example, although N ∈{N}, lNl = ℵ0 while l{N}l = 1. Intuitively, we think of {N} as no smaller than N. As such, we deﬁne the hereditary cardinality, hcard(x), of a set x, as the cardinality of its transitive closure: hcard(x) = ltrcl(x)l The corresponding cardinal-gradation is deﬁned as follows. For each cardinal κ, H(κ) = {x : ltrcl(x) < κ}. 77 The members of H(ω) are called the hereditarily ﬁnite sets and the members of H(ω1) are called the hereditarily countable sets. The next theorem lists some important properties of H. Theorem 37. 1. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, H(κ) is transitive. 2. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, ∀x hcard(x) < κ →rank(x) < κ. 3. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, H(κ) ⊆R(κ). 4. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, ∃z z = H(κ). 5. ∀x ∃κ (κ is a cardinal and x ∈H(κ)); i.e, V = S{H(κ) : κ is a cardinal}. Proof. 1. Apply part (2) of Theorem 33. 2. Case 1: κ is regular. The proof is by ∈-induction on V, noting that if rank(y) < κ for each y ∈x and lxl < κ, then rank(x) < κ. Case 2: κ is singular. There is a regular cardinal λ such that hcard(x) < λ < κ; now use Case 1. 3. This follows from (2) and Theorem 36. 4. Apply (3) and Comprehension. 5. This follows since ∀x ∃κ hcard(x) = κ. Theorem 38. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then H(κ) = R(κ). 78 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE Proof. From Theorem 37 we have H(κ) ⊆R(κ). For the reverse containment, let x ∈R(κ). By Theorem 36, ∃α < κ such that x ∈R(α + 1) \ R(α). So x ⊆R(α). Since R(α) is transitive, trcl(x) ⊆R(α). It suﬃces to prove by induction that ∀α < κ lR(α)l < κ.
