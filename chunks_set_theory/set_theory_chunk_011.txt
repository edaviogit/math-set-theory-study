Φ(m, f2lm, f2(m), ⃗w). By transitivity j ∈x ∪{x} for all j ∈m and so by the inductive hypothesis f1lm = f2lm. Now by the hypothesis of this theorem with f = f1lm = f2lm we deduce that f1(m) = f2(m). This concludes the proof of the claim. In order to verify (1), it suﬃces to show that (∀x ∈N)(∃y) [⟨x, y⟩∈F] by induction. To this end, we assume that (∀j ∈x)(∃y) [⟨j, y⟩∈F] with intent to show that ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈F. For each j ∈x there is nj ∈N and fj : nj →V such that (∀m ∈nj) Φ(m, fjlm, fj(m), ⃗w). If x ∈nj for some j, then ⟨x, fj(x)⟩∈F and we are done; so assume that nj ≤x for all j. Let g = S{fj : j ∈x}. By the claim, the fj’s agree on their common domains, so that g is a function with domain x and (∀m ∈x) Φ(m, glm, g(m), ⃗w). By the hypothesis of the theorem applied to g there is a unique y such that Φ(x, g, y, ⃗w). Deﬁne f to be the function f = g ∪{⟨x, y⟩}. It is straightfor- ward to verify that f witnesses that ⟨x, y⟩∈F. To prove (2), note that, by (1), for each x ∈N there is n ∈N and f : n →V such that F(x) = f(x) and, in fact, Fln = f. Hence, (∀m ∈n) Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w). 38 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We prove (3) by induction. Assume that (∀m ∈n) H(m) = F(m) with intent to show that H(n) = F(n). We assume Φ(n, Hln, H(n), ⃗w) and by (2) we have Φ(n, Fln, F(n), ⃗w). By the hypothesis of the theorem applied to Hln = Fln we get H(n) = F(n). By applying this theorem to our speciﬁc example we see that REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) does indeed give us a function F. Since F is deﬁned by recursion on N, we use induction on N to verify the properties of F. For example, it is easy to use induction to check that F(n) ∈N for all n ∈N. We do not often explicitly state the formula Φ in a deﬁnition by recursion. The deﬁnition of F would be more often given by: F(0) = 3 F(succ(n)) = succ(F(n)) This is just how the example started; nevertheless, this allows us to construct the formula Φ immediately, should we wish. Of course, in this particular example we can use the plus symbol and give the deﬁnition by recursion by the following formulas. 3 + 0 = 3 3 + succ(n) = succ(3 + n) Now, let’s use deﬁnition by recursion in other examples. We can deﬁne general addition on N by the formulas a + 0 = a a + succ(b) = succ(a + b) for each a ∈N. Here a is a parameter which is allowed by the inclusion of ⃗w in our analysis. The same trick can be used for multiplicaton: a · 0 = 0 a · (succ(b)) = a · b + a 39 for each a ∈N, using the previously deﬁned notion of addition. In each example there are two cases to specify—the zero case and the successor case. Exponentiation is deﬁned similarly: a0 = 1 asucc(b) = ab · a The reader is invited to construct, in each case, the appropriate formula Φ, with a as a parameter, and to check that the hypothesis of the previous theorem is satisﬁed. G. Peano developed the properties of the natural numbers from zero, the successor operation and induction on N. You may like to see for yourself some of what this entails by proving that multiplication is commutative. A set X is said to be ﬁnite provided that there is a natural number n and a bijection f : n →X. In this case n is said to be the size of X. Otherwise, X is said to be inﬁnite. Exercise 6. Use induction to prove the ”pigeon-hole principle”: for n ∈N there is no injection f : (n + 1) →n. Conclude that a set X cannot have two diﬀerent sizes. Do not believe this next result: Proposition. All natural numbers are equal. Proof. It is suﬃcient to show by induction on n ∈N that if a ∈N and b ∈N and max (a, b) = n, then a = b. If n = 0 then a = 0 = b. Assume the inductive hypothesis for n and let a ∈N and b ∈N be such that max (a, b) = n + 1. Then max (a −1, b −1) = n and so a −1 = b −1 and consequently a = b. 40 CHAPTER 4.
