M 1 ↔ΨM 2 ); 7. If Φ is (∀vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∀vi ∈M)ΨM; and, 8. If Φ is (∃vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∃vi ∈M)ΨM. We write M l= Φ for ΦM and moreover whenever Φ has no free variables we say that M is a model of Φ. We denote by ZFC the collection of axioms which include: Equality, Extensionality, Existence, Pairing, Foundation, Union, Intersection, the Re- placement Scheme, Power Set, Choice and Inﬁnity. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for the Axiom of Inﬁnity, we have: Lemma. Φ R(ω) l= Φ. 83 Lemma. If M is transitive, then M models Equality, Extensionality, Exis- tence and Foundation. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for those in the Replacement Scheme, we have: Theorem 40. For each uncountable κ, R(κ) l= Φ. Exercise 30. Prove the above theorem scheme. Use the fact that V l= Φ. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for Power Set, we have: Theorem 41. For each uncountable regular cardinal κ, H(κ) l= Φ. Exercise 31. Prove the above theorem scheme. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then R(κ) = H(κ) l= Φ, for each axiom Φ of ZFC. Lemma. If κ is the least inaccessible cardinal, then H(κ) l= ¬∃an inaccessible cardinal. From this lemma we can infer that there is no proof, from ZFC, that there is an inaccessible cardinal. Suppose Θ is the conjuction of all the (ﬁnitely many) axioms used in such a proof. Then from Θ we can derive (∃λ)(λ is an inaccessible). Let κ be the least inaccessible cardinal. Then H(κ) l= Θ so H(κ) l= (∃λ)(λ is an inaccessible). This assumes that our proof system is sound; i.e., if from Θ1 we can derive Θ2 and M l= Θ1, then M l= Θ2. We conclude that ZFC plus “¬∃an inaccessible” is consistent. We can also infer that ZFC minus “Inﬁnity” plus “¬(∃z)(z = N)” is consistent. Suppose not. Suppose Θ is the conjuction of the ﬁnitely many axioms of ZFC −Inf needed to prove (∃z)(z = N). Then H(ω) l= Θ, so H(ω) l= (∃z)(z = N), which is a contradiction. 84 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION In fact, given any collection of formulas without free variables and a class M such that for each Φ in the collection M l= Φ, we can then conclude that the collection is consistent. For example, ZFC minus “Power Set” plus “(∀x)(x is countable)” is con- sistent: Lemma. H(ω1) l= (∀x)(x is countable). If Φ(v0, . . . , vk) is a formula of the language of set theory and M = {x : χM(x,⃗v)} and C = {x : χC(x,⃗v)} are classes, then we say Φ is absolute between M and C whenever (∀v0 ∈M ∩C) . . . (∀vk ∈M ∩C) [ΦM ↔ΦC]. This concept is most often used when M ⊆C. When C = V, we say that Φ is absolute for M. For classes M = {x : χM(x,⃗v)} and C = {x : χC(x,⃗v)} with M ⊆C and a list Φ0, . . . , Φm of formulas of set theory such that for each i ≤m every subformula of Φi is contained in the list, we have: Lemma. χM, χC, Φ1, . . . , Φm The following are equivalent: 1. Each of Φ1, . . . , Φm are absolute between M and C. 2. Whenever Φi is ∃x Φj(x,⃗v) for i, j ≤m we have (∀v1 ∈M . . . ∀vk ∈M)(∃x ∈C ΦC j (x,⃗v) →∃x ∈M ΦC j (x,⃗v)). The latter statement is called the Tarski-Vaught Condition. Proof. ((1) ⇒(2)) 85 Let v0 ∈M, . . . , vk ∈M and suppose ∃x ∈C ΦC j (x, v0, . . . , vk). Then ΦC i (v0, . . . , vk) holds. By absoluteness ΦM i (v0, . . . , vk) holds; i.e., ∃x ∈M ΦM j (x, v0, . . . , vk), so by absoluteness of Φj(x, v0, . . . , vk) for x ∈M we have ∃x ∈M ΦC j (x, v0, . . . , vk). (2) ⇒(1) This is proved by induction on complexity of Φi, noting that each sub- formula appears in the list. There is no problem with the atomic formula step since atomic formulas are always absolute. Similarly, the negation and connective steps are easy. Now if Φi is ∃x Φj and each of v1, . . . , vk is in M we have ΦM i (v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈M ΦM j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈M ΦC j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈C ΦC j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔ΦC i (v1, . . . , vk) where the second implication is due to the inductive hypothesis and the third implication is by part (2). The next theorem scheme is called the Levy Reﬂection Principle. For each formula Φ of the language of set theory, we have: Theorem 42.
