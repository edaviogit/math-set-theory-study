e inductive hypothesis and the third implication is by part (2). The next theorem scheme is called the Levy Reﬂection Principle. For each formula Φ of the language of set theory, we have: Theorem 42. Φ ∀α ∈ON ∃β ∈ON [β > α and Φ is absolute for R(β)]. If, in addition, Φ has no free variables then Φ implies R(β) l= Φ. This is interpreted as the truth of Φ being reﬂected to R(β). Proof. Form a collection Φ1, . . . , Φm of all the subformulas of Φ. We will use the Tarski-Vaught Condition for Φ1, . . . , Φm to get absoluteness between R(β) and V; but ﬁrst we must ﬁnd β. 86 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION For each i = 1, . . . , m such that Φi is ∃x Ψ for some formula Ψ we deﬁne fi such that fi : V →ON by setting fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) = min {γ : γ ∈ON ∧∃x ∈R(γ) Ψ(x, y1, . . . , yli)} if such an ordinal exists, and fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) = α otherwise. Now deﬁne h: ω →ON by recursion by the formulas h(0) = α h(n + 1) = sup {fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) : 1 ≤i < m and each yj ∈R(h(n))} and then let β = sup {h(n) : n ∈ω}. This β works. The analogous theorem scheme can be proven for the H(κ) hierarchy as well. We can now argue that ZFC cannot be ﬁnitely axiomatised. That is, there is no one formula without free variables which implies all axioms of ZFC and is, in tum, implied by ZFC. Suppose such a Φ exists. By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, choose the least β ∈ON such that ΦR(β). We have R(β) l= Φ. Hence R(β) l= ∃α ∈ON ΦR(α), since this instance of the theorem follows from ZFC. Thus, (∃α ∈ON ΦR(α))R(β). That is, ∃α ∈(ON ∩R(β)) ΦR(α)∩R(β). But ON ∩R(β) = β, the ordinals of rank < β. So, α < β and we have ∃α < β ΦR(α), contradicting the minimality of β. For any formula Φ of the language of set theory with no free variables and classes M = {v : χM(v)}, C = {v : χC(v)}, and F = {v : χF(v)} we have: Lemma. Φ, χM, χC, χF If F : M →C is an isomorphism then Φ is absolute between M and C. That is, M l= Φ iﬀC l= Φ. 87 Proof. It is easy to show by induction on the complexity of Φ that Ψ(x1, . . . , xk) ⇔Ψ(F(x1), . . . , F(xk)) for each subformula Ψ of Φ. A bounded formula (also called a △0 formula) is one which is built up as usual with respect to atomic formulas and connectives, but where each ∃x Φ clause is replaced by ∃x ∈y Φ, and the ∀x Φ clause is replaced by ∀x ∈y Φ. △0 formulas are absolute for transitive models. That is, for each △0 formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w) and for each class M = {x : χM(x, ⃗w)} we have: Theorem 43. Φ, χM ∀⃗w if M is transitive, then (∀v0 ∈M) . . . (∀vk ∈M) [ΦM(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w) ↔Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)] Proof. We use induction on the complexity of Φ. We only show the ∃step. Suppose [(∀v0 ∈M) . . . (∀vk ∈M) ΦM(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)] ↔Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w). We wish to consider (∃vi ∈vj) Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w). Fix any v0, . . . , vk ∈M, but not vi; however, vj is ﬁxed in M. Now (∃vi ∈vj Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w))M →(∃vi ∈vj Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)) since ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) →Φ(⃗v, ⃗w). Also, (∃vi ∈vj) Φ(⃗v, ⃗w) →(∃vi ∈vj) ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) since Φ(⃗v, ⃗w) →ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) →∃vi ∈(vj ∩M) ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) since vj ∈M implies vj ⊆M →((∃vi ∈vj) Φ(⃗v, ⃗w))M 88 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION A formula Φ(⃗w) is said to be △T 1 , where T is a subcollection of ZFC, whenever there are △0 formulas Φ1(⃗v, ⃗w) and Φ2(⃗v, ⃗w) such that using only the axioms from T we can prove that both: (∀⃗w)(Φ1(⃗w) ↔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Φ1(⃗v, ⃗w)) (∀⃗w)(Φ2(⃗w) ↔∀v0 . . . ∀vk Φ2(⃗v, ⃗w)). We can now use the above theorem to show that if Φ(⃗w) is a △T 1 formula and M l= Θ for each Θ in T, then Φ(⃗w) is absolute for M, whenever M is transitive. We do so as follows, letting Ψ play the role of Ψ1 above: Φ(⃗w) ⇔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w) ⇔(∃v0 ∈M) . . . (∃vk ∈M) [Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w)] ⇔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w)M ⇔Φ(⃗w)M The ﬁrst and third implications accrue from Φ(⃗w) being △T 1 ; the second from the fact that Ψ is △0 and M is transitive and models the axioms of T. This is often used with T as ZFC without Power Set and M = H(κ).
