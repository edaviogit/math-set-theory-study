r 2 FOUND The language of set theory is very precise, but it is extremely diﬃcult for us to read mathematical formulas in that language. We need to ﬁnd a way to make these formulas more intelligible. In order to avoid the inconsistencies associated with Richard’s paradox, we must ensure that the formula Φ in the class {vj : Φ} is indeed a proper formula of the language of set theory—or, at least, can be converted to a proper formula once the abbreviations are eliminated. It is not so important that we actually write classes using proper formulas, but what is important is that whatever formula we write down can be converted into a proper formula by eliminating abbreviations and slang. We can now relax our formalism if we keep the previous paragraph in mind. Let’s adopt these conventions. 1. We can use any letters that we like for variables, not just v0, v1, v2, . . . . 2. We can freely omit parentheses and sometimes use brackets ] and [ instead. 3. We can write out “and” for “∧”, “or” for “∨”, “implies” for “→” and use the “if...then...” format as well as other common English expres- sions for the logical connectives and quantiﬁers. 19 20 CHAPTER 2. FOUND 4. We will use the notation Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wk) to indicate that all free variables of Φ lie among x, y, w1, . . . , wk. When the context is clear we use the notation Φ(x, t, w1, . . . , wk) for the result of substituting the term t for each free occurrence of the variable y in Φ, i.e., Φ(ylt). 5. We can write out formulas, including statements of theorems, in any way easily seen to be convertible to a proper formula in the language of set theory. For any terms r, s, and t, we make the following abbreviations of formulas. (∀x ∈t)Φ for (∀x)(x ∈t →Φ) (∃x ∈t)Φ for (∃x)(x ∈t ∧Φ) s /∈t for ¬(s ∈t) s ̸= t for ¬(s = t) s ⊆t for (∀x)(x ∈s →x ∈t) Whenever we have a ﬁnite number of terms t1, t2, . . . , tn the notation {t1, t2, . . . , tn} is used as an abbreviation for the class: {x : x = t1 ∨x = t2 ∨· · · ∨x = tn}. Furthermore, {t : Φ} will stand for {x : x = t ∧Φ}, while {x ∈t : Φ} will represent {x : x ∈t ∧Φ}. We also abbreviate the following important classes. Union s ∪t for {x : x ∈s ∨x ∈t} Intersection s ∩t for {x : x ∈s ∧x ∈t} Diﬀerence s \ t for {x : x ∈s ∧x /∈t} Symmetric Diﬀerence s△t for (s \ t) ∪(t \ s) Ordered Pair ⟨s, t⟩ for {{s}, {s, t}} Cartesian Product s × t for {p : ∃x ∃y (x ∈s ∧y ∈t ∧p = ⟨x, y⟩)} Domain dom(f) for {x : ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Range mg(f) for {y : ∃x ⟨x, y⟩∈f} 21 Image f →A for {y : ∃x ∈A ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Inverse Image f ←B for {x : ∃y ∈B ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Restriction flA for {p : p ∈f ∧∃x ∈A ∃y p = ⟨x, y⟩} Inverse f −1 for {p : ∃x ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f ∧⟨y, x⟩= p} These latter abbreviations are most often used when f is a function. We write f is a function for ∀p ∈f ∃x ∃y p = ⟨x, y⟩∧(∀x)(∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f →∃!y ⟨x, y⟩∈f) and we write f : X →Y for f is a function ∧dom(f) = X ∧mg(f) ⊆Y f is one −to −one for ∀y ∈mg(f) ∃!x ⟨x, y⟩∈f f is onto Y for Y = mg(f) We also use the terms injection (for a one-to-one function), surjection (for an onto function), and bijection (for both properties together). Russell’s Paradox The following is a theorem. ¬∃z z = {x : x /∈x}. The proof of this is simple. Just ask whether or not z ∈z. The paradox is only for the naive, not for us. {x : x /∈x} is a class—just a description in the language of set theory. There is no reason why what it describes should exist. In everyday life we describe many things which don’t exist, ﬁctional characters for example. Bertrand Russell did exist and Peter Pan did not, although they each have descriptions in English. Although Peter Pan does not exist, we still ﬁnd it worthwhile to speak about him. The same is true in mathematics. Upon reﬂection, you might say that in fact, nothing is an element of itself so that {x : x /∈x} = {x : x = x} = V 22 CHAPTER 2. FOUND and so Russell’s paradox leads to: ¬∃z z = V. It seems we have proved that the universe does not exists. A pity.
