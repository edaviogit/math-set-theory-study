transitive subset of N containing l (e.g., t = l ∪{l}). By Comprehension, ∃s s = {n ∈t : ¬Φ(n, ⃗w)}. By Foundation, we get y ∈s such that y ∩s = ∅. Transitivity of t guarantees that (∀n ∈y) Φ(n, ⃗w). This, in tum, contradicts that y ∈s. The statement ∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w) in Theorem 8 Φ is usually called the inductive hypothesis. Exercise 5. Prove or disprove that for each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) we have ∀⃗w [(∀n ∈N)((∀m > n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)) →∀n ∈N Φ(n, ⃗w)]. Recursion on N is a way of deﬁning new terms (in particular, functions with domain N). Roughly speaking, values of a function F at larger numbers are deﬁned in terms of the values of F at smaller numbers. We begin with the example of a function F, where we set F(0) = 3 and F(succ(n)) = succ(F(n)) for each natural number n. We have set out a short recursive procedure which gives a way to calculate F(n) for any n ∈N. The reader may carry out this procedure a few steps and recognise this function F as F(n) = 3 + n. However, all this is a little vague. What exactly is F. 35 In particular, is there a formula for calculating F. How do we verify that F behaves like we think it should. In order to give some answers to these questions, let us analyse the ex- ample. There is an implicit formula for the calculation of y = F(x) which is [x = 0 →y = 3] ∧(∀n ∈N)[x = succ(n) →y = succ(F(n))] However the formula involves F, the very thing that we are trying to describe. Is this a vicious circle. No — the formula only involves the value of F at a number n less than x, not F(x) itself. In fact, you might say that the formula doesn’t really involve F at all; it just involves Flx. Let’s rewrite the formula as [x = 0 →y = 3] ∧(∀n)[x = succ(n) →y = succ(f(n))] and denote it by Φ(x, f, y). Our recursive procedure is then described by Φ(x, Flx, F(x)). In order to describe F we use functions f which approximate F on initial parts of its domain, for example f = {⟨0, 3⟩}, f = {⟨0, 3⟩, ⟨1, 4⟩} or f = {⟨0, 3⟩, ⟨1, 4⟩, ⟨2, 5⟩}, where each such f satisﬁes Φ(x, flx, f(x)) for the appropriate x’s. We will obtain F as the amalgamation of all these little f’s. F is {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈N)(∃f)[f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m))]}. But in order to justify this we will need to notice that (∀x ∈N)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y)], which simply states that we have a well deﬁned procedure given by Φ. Let us now go to the general context in which the above example will be a special case. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈N)(∃f)[f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. 36 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We will show, under the appropriate hypothesis, that REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) is the unique function on N which satisﬁes the procedure given by Φ. This requires a theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 9. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x ∈N)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, N, ⃗w), we have: 1. F : N →V; 2. ∀m ∈N Φ(m, Flm, F(m), ⃗w); and, furthermore, for any n ∈N and any function H with n ∈dom(H), we have: 3. If Φ(m, Hlm, H(m), ⃗w) for all m ∈n ∪{n}, then H(n) = F(n). Proof. We ﬁrst prove the following claim. Claim. (∀x ∈N)(∀y1)(∀y2)[(⟨x, y1⟩∈F ∧⟨x, y2⟩∈F →y1 = y2] Proof of Claim. By deﬁnition of F we have, for i = 1, 2, functions fi with domains ni ∈N such that fi(x) = yi and (∀m ∈ni) Φ(m, film, fi(m), ⃗w). It suﬃces to prove that (∀m ∈N)(m ∈x ∪{x} →f1(m) = f2(m)), which we do by induction on m ∈N. To this end, we assume that m ∈N and (∀j ∈m)(j ∈x ∪{x} →f1(j) = f2(j)) 37 with intent to show that m ∈x ∪{x} →f1(m) = f2(m). To do this suppose m ∈x ∪{x}. Since x ∈n1 ∩n2 we have m ∈n1 ∩n2 so that we have both Φ(m, f1lm, f1(m), ⃗w) and Φ(m, f2lm, f2(m), ⃗w). By transitivity j ∈x ∪{x} for all j ∈m and so by the inductive hypothesis f1lm = f2lm. Now by the hypothesis of this theorem with f = f1lm = f2lm we deduce that f1(m) = f2(m).
