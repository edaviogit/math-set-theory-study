e x < y for ⟨x, y⟩∈R. Whenever ∃z z = ⟨X, <⟩and < is a partial ordering on X, we say that ⟨X, <⟩is a parially ordered set. We similarly have the concepts of linearly ordered set and well ordered set. The study of partially ordered sets continues to be a major theme in contemporary Set Theory and the construction of elaborate partial orders is of great technical importance. In contrast, well orders have been thoroughly analysed and we shall now classify all well ordered sets. Theorem 21. Each well ordered set is isomorphic to a unique ordinal. Proof. Since well orders are extensional and well founded we can use the Mostowski Collapsing Theorem. By Exercise 16 the resulting transitive set is an ordinal. The unique ordinal given by this theorem is called the order type of the well ordered set. We denote the order type of ⟨X, <⟩by type⟨X, <⟩. 57 We now come to the Well Ordering Principle, which is the fundamental theorem of Set Theory due to E. Zermelo. In order to prove it we use the Axiom of Choice and, for the ﬁrst time, the Power Set Axiom. Theorem 22. (∀X)(∃<) [⟨X, <⟩is a well ordered set]. Proof. We begin by using Theorem 5 to obtain a choice function f : P(X) \ {∅} →X such that for each nonempty A ⊆X we have f(A) ∈A. By recursion on ON we deﬁne g : ON →X ∪{X} as: g(β) = ( f(X \ {g(α) : α < β}), if X \ {g(α) : α < β} ̸= ∅; X, otherwise. (6.1) Now replace each x ∈X ∩ran(g) by the unique ordinal β such that g(β) = x. The Axiom of Replacement gives the resulting set S ⊆ON, where S = {β ∈ON : g(β) ∈X}. By Theorem 10 there is a δ ∈ON \ S. Choosing any such, we must have g(δ) /∈X; that is, g(δ) = X and so X ⊆{g(α) : α < δ}. It is now straightforward to verify that {⟨x, y⟩∈X × X : x = g(α) and y = g(β) for some α < β < δ} is a well ordering of X, which completes the proof. This Well Ordering Principle is used frequently in modem Set Theory. In fact, most uses of the Axiom of Choice are via the Well Ordering Principle. The Power Set Axiom, ﬁrst used in this proof, will now also be used frequently without special mention. 58 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS Chapter 7 Cardinality In this chapter, we investigate a concept which aims to translate our intuitive notion of size into formal language. By Zermelo’s Well Ordering Principle (Theorem 22) every set can be well ordered. By Theorem 21, every well ordered set is isomorphic to an ordinal. Therefore, for any set x there is some ordinal κ ∈ON and a bijection f : x →κ. We deﬁne the cardinality of x, lxl, to be the least κ ∈ON such that there is some bijection f : x →κ. Every set has a cardinality. Those ordinals which are lxl for some x are called cardinals. Exercise 19. Prove that each n ∈ω is a cardinal and that ω is a cardinal. Show that ω + 1 is not a cardinal and that, in fact, each other cardinal is a limit ordinal. Theorem 23. The following are equivalent. 1. κ is a cardinal. 2. (∀α < κ)(¬∃bijection f : κ →α); i.e., lκl = κ. 3. (∀α < κ)(¬∃injection f : κ →α). 59 60 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY Proof. We prove the negations of each are equivalent: ¬(1) (∀x)[(∃bijection g: x →κ) →(∃α < κ)(∃bijection h: x →α)] ¬(2) ∃α < κ ∃bijection f : κ →α ¬(3) ∃α < κ ∃injection f : κ →α ¬(2) ⇒¬(1) Just take h = f ◦g. ¬(1) ⇒¬(3) Just consider x = κ. ¬(3) ⇒¬(2) Suppose α < κ and f : κ →α is an injection. By Theorem 21, there is an isomorphism g: β →f →κ for some β ∈ON. Since g is order preserving, we must have γ ≤g(γ) for each γ ∈β and hence β ≤α. Now g−1 ◦f : κ →β is the desired bijection. The following exercises are applications of the theorem. The ﬁrst two statements relate to the questions raised in the introduction. Exercise 20. Prove the following: 1. lxl = lyl iﬀ∃bijection f : x →y. 2. lxl ≤lyl iﬀ∃injection f : x →y. 3. lxl ≥lyl iﬀ∃surjection f : x →y. Assume here that y ̸= ∅. Theorem 24. (G. Cantor) ∀x lxl < lP(x)l. Proof. First note that if lxl ≥lP(x)l, then there would be a surjection g: x →P(x). But this cannot happen, since {a ∈x : a /∈g(a)} /∈g→(x).
