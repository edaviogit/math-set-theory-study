the reverse containment, let x ∈R(κ). By Theorem 36, ∃α < κ such that x ∈R(α + 1) \ R(α). So x ⊆R(α). Since R(α) is transitive, trcl(x) ⊆R(α). It suﬃces to prove by induction that ∀α < κ lR(α)l < κ. For successor α = β + 1, we note that lP(λ)l < κ, where λ = lR(β)l; for limit α we apply Theorem 36, observing that κ is regular. Chapter 10 Reﬂection There is a generalisation of the Equality Axiom, called the Equality Principle, which states that for any formula Φ we have x = y implying that Φ holds at x iﬀΦ holds at y. The proof requires a new technique, called induction on complexity of the formula. We make this precise. For each formula Φ of set theory all of whose free variables lie among v0, . . . , vn we write Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and for each i and j with 0 ≤i ≤n, we denote by Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) the result of substituting vj for each free occurance of vi. For each formula Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and each i and j with 0 ≤i ≤n we have: Theorem 39. Φ, i, j ∀v0 . . . ∀vi . . . ∀vn∀vj[vi = vj →(Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔(Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))] This is a scheme of theorems, one for each appropriate Φ, i, j. Proof. The proof will come in two steps. 1. We ﬁrst prove this for atomic formulas Φ. 79 80 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION Case 1 Φ is vi ∈vk where i ̸= k This is true by Axiom of Equality. Case 2 Φ is vk ∈vi where i ̸= k This is true by Axiom of Extensionality. Case 3 Φ is vi ∈vi This is true since by Theorem 2 both vi ∈vj and vj ∈vi are false. Case 4 Φ is vk ∈vk where i ̸= k This is true since both Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) are the same. Case 5 Φ is vi = vk where i ̸= k This is true by Theorem 1. Case 6 Φ is vk = vi where i ̸= k This is similar to case 5. Case 7 Φ is vi = vi This is true since by Theorem 1 both vi = vi and vj = vj are true. Case 8 Φ is vk = vk where i ̸= k This is similar to case 4. 2. We now show that for any subformula Ωof Φ, if the theorem is true for all proper subformulas of Ωthen it is true for Ω. Here Θ and Ψ are subformulas of Ωand Ωis expressed in parentheses for each case according to how Ωis built. Case 1 (¬Θ) This is true since if Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) then ¬Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔¬Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) Case 2 (Θ ∧Ψ) From the hypothesis that Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) and Ψ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Ψ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) 81 we obain Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ∧Ψ(v0, . . . , vn) iﬀ Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) ∧Ψ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn). Cases 3 through 5 result from Cases 1 and 2. Case 3 (Θ ∨Ψ) Case 4 (Θ →Ψ) Case 5 (Θ ↔Ψ) Case 6 (∀vk Θ) and i ̸= k We have ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn)]. If vk is not free in Θ, then Θ ↔∀vk Θ and we are done. If vk is free in Θ, then since 0 ≤k ≤n we have ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj ∀vk [vi = vj →Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn)] and so ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →(∀vk)(Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))] and so ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →(∀vk)Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔(∀vk)Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))]. Case 7 (∃vk) Θ) and i ̸= k This follows from Cases 1 and 6. Case 8 (∀vi Θ) This is true since vi is not free in Φ, hence Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) is Φ(v0, . . . , vn). 82 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION Case 9 (∃vi) Θ) This is similar to case 8. We conclude that the theorem scheme holds for all appropriate Φ, i, j. Let M be a term and Φ any formula of the language of set theory. We deﬁne the relativisation of Φ to M, denoted by ΦM, as follows: 1. If Φ is atomic then ΦM is Φ; 2. If Φ is ¬Ψ then ΦM is ¬ΨM; 3. If Φ is (Ψ1 ∧Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ∧ΨM 2 ); 4. If Φ is (Ψ1 ∨Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ∨ΨM 2 ); 5. If Φ is (Ψ1 →Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 →ΨM 2 ); 6. If Φ is (Ψ1 ↔Ψ2); then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ↔ΨM 2 ); 7. If Φ is (∀vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∀vi ∈M)ΨM; and, 8. If Φ is (∃vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∃vi ∈M)ΨM. We write M l= Φ for ΦM and moreover whenever Φ has no free variables we say that M is a model of Φ.
