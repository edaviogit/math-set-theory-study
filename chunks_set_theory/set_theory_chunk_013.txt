∃f)[f : n →V∧f(x) = y∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. Transﬁnite recursion is justiﬁed by the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 14. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x ∈ON)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, ON, ⃗w), we have: 45 1. F : ON →V; 2. ∀x ∈ON Φ(x, Flx, F(x), ⃗w); and, furthermore, for any n ∈ON and any function H with n ∈ dom(H) we have: 3. If Φ(x, Hlx, H(x), ⃗w) for all x ∈n ∪{n} then H(n) = F(n). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem scheme can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem Scheme 9. When applying transﬁnite recursion on ON we often have three sepa- rate cases to specify, rather than just two as with recursion on N. This is illustrated by the recursive deﬁnitions of the arithmetic operations on ON. Addition: α + 0 = α; α + succ(β) = succ(α + β); α + δ = sup {α + η : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Multiplication: α · 0 = 0; α · succ(β) = (α · β) + α; α · δ = sup {α · η : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Exponentiation: α0 = 1; αsucc(β) = (αβ) · α; αδ = sup {αη : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Note that, in each case, we are extending the operation from N to all of ON. The following theorem shows that these operations behave somewhat similarly on N and ON. 46 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Theorem 15. Let α, β, and δ be ordinals and S be a non-empty set of ordinals. We have, 1. 0 + α = α; 2. If β < δ then α + β < α + δ; 3. α + sup S = sup {α + η : η ∈S}; 4. α + (β + δ) = (α + β) + δ; 5. If α < β then α + δ ≤β + δ; 6. 0 · α = 0; 7. 1 · α = α; 8. If 0 < α and β < δ then α · β < α · δ; 9. α · sup S = sup {α · η : η ∈S}; 10. α · (β + δ) = (α · β) + (α · δ); 11. α · (β · δ) = (α · β) · δ; 12. If α < β then α · δ ≤β · δ; 13. 1α = 1; 14. If 1 < α and β < δ then αβ < αδ; 15. αsup S = sup {αη : η ∈S}; 16. α(β+δ) = αβ · αδ; 17. (αβ)δ = αβ·δ; and, 18. If α < β then αδ ≤βδ. Exercise 10. Build your transﬁnite induction skills by proving two parts of this theorem. 47 However, ordinal addition and multiplication are not commutative. This is illustrated by the following examples, which are easy to verify from the basic deﬁnitions. Examples. 1. 1 + ω = 2 + ω 2. 1 + ω ̸= ω + 1 3. 1 · ω = 2 · ω 4. 2 · ω ̸= ω · 2 5. 2ω = 4ω 6. (2 · 2)ω ̸= 2ω · 2ω Lemma. If β is a non-zero ordinal then ωβ is a limit ordinal. Exercise 11. Prove this lemma. Lemma. If α is a non-zero ordinal, then there is a largest ordinal β such that ωβ ≤α. Exercise 12. Prove this lemma. Show that the β ≤α and that there are cases in which β = α. Such ordinals β are called epsilon numbers (The smallest such ordinal α = ωα is called ϵ0.) Lemma. ∀α ∈ON ∀β ∈α ∃!γ ∈ON α = β + γ. Exercise 13. Prove this lemma. Commonly, any function f with dom(f) ⊆ω is called a sequence. If dom(f) ⊆n + 1 for some n ∈ω, we say that f is a ﬁnite sequence; otherwise f is an inﬁnite sequence. As usual, we denote the sequence f by {fn}, where each fn = f(n). Theorem 16. There is no inﬁnite descending sequence of ordinals. 48 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Proof. Let’s use an indirect proof. Suppose x ⊆ω is inﬁnite and f : x →ON such that if n < m then f(n) > f(m). Let X = {f(n) : n ∈x}. By Foundation there is y ∈X such that y ∩X = ∅; i.e., there is n ∈x such that f(n) ∩X = ∅. However, if m ∈x and m > n then f(m) ∈f(n), which is a contradiction. If n ∈ω and s: (n + 1) →ON is a ﬁnite sequence of ordinals, then the sum n X i=0 s(i) is deﬁned by recursion as follows. 0 X i=0 s(i) = s(0); and, m+1 X i=0 s(i) = m X i=0 s(i) + s(m + 1), for m < n. This shows that statements like the following theorem can be written precisely in the language of set theory. Theorem 17. (Cantor Normal Form) For each non-zero ordinal α there is a unique n ∈ω and ﬁnite sequences m0, . . . , mn of positive natural numbers and β0, . . . , βn of ordinals which sat- isfy β0 > β1 > · · · > βn such that α = ωβ0m0 + ωβ1m1 + · · · + ωβnmn.
