is a unique n ∈ω and ﬁnite sequences m0, . . . , mn of positive natural numbers and β0, . . . , βn of ordinals which sat- isfy β0 > β1 > · · · > βn such that α = ωβ0m0 + ωβ1m1 + · · · + ωβnmn. Proof. Using the penultimate lemma, let β0 = max {β : ωβ ≤α} and then let m0 = max {m ∈ω : ωβ0m ≤α} which must exist since ωβ0m ≤α for all m ∈ω would imply that ωβ0+1 ≤α. 49 By the previous lemma, there is some α0 ∈ON such that α = ωβ0m0 + α0 where the maximality of m0 ensures that α0 < ωβ0. Now let β1 = max {β : ωβ ≤α0} so that β1 < β0. Proceed to get m1 = max {m ∈ω : ωβ1m ≤α0} and α1 < ωβ1 such that α0 = ωβ1m1 + α1. We continue in this manner as long as possible. We must have to stop after a ﬁnite number of steps or else β0 > β1 > β2 > . . . would be an inﬁnite decreasing sequence of ordinals. The only way we could stop would be if some αn = 0. This proves the existence of the sum. Uniqueness follows by induction on α ∈ON. Exercise 14. Verify the last statement of this proof. Lemma. 1. If 0 < m < ω and α is a non-zero ordinal, then m · ωα = ωα. 2. If k ∈ω, and m0, . . . , mk < ω, and α0, . . . , αk < β, then m0 · ωα0 + · · · + mk · ωαk < ωβ. Exercise 15. Prove this lemma and note that it implies that m · δ = δ for each positive integer m and each limit ordinal δ. There is an interesting application of ordinal arithmetic to Number The- ory. Pick a number—say x = 54. We have 54 = 25 + 24 + 22 + 2 when it is written as the simplest sum of powers of 2. In fact, we can write out 54 using only the the arithmetic operations and the numbers 1 and 2. This will be the ﬁrst step in a recursively deﬁned sequence of natural numbers, {xn}. It begins with n = 2 and is constructed as follows. x2 = 54 = 2(22+1) + 222 + 22 + 2. 50 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Subtract 1. x2 −1 = 2(22+1) + 222 + 22 + 1. Change all 2’s to 3’s, leaving the 1’s alone. x3 = 3(33+1) + 333 + 33 + 1. Subtract 1. x3 −1 = 3(33+1) + 333 + 33. Change all 3’s to 4’s, leaving any 1’s or 2’s alone. x4 = 4(44+1) + 444 + 44. Subtract 1. x4 −1 = 4(44+1) + 444 + 3 · 43 + 3 · 42 + 3 · 4 + 3. Change all 4’s to 5’s, leaving any 1’s, 2’s or 3’s alone. x5 = 5(55+1) + 555 + 3 · 53 + 3 · 52 + 3 · 5 + 3. Subtract 1 and continue, changing 5’s to 6’s, subtracting 1, changing 6’s to 7’s and so on. One may ask the value of the limit lim n→∞xn. What is your guess. The answer is surprising. Theorem 18. (Goodstein) For any initial choice of x there is some n such that xn = 0. Proof. We use an indirect proof; suppose x ∈N and for all n ≥2 we have xn ̸= 0. From this sequence, we construct another sequence. For each n ≥2 we let gn be the result of replacing each occurrence of n in xn by ω. So, in the example above we would get: g2 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω + ω, g3 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω + 1, g4 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω, g5 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + 3 · ω3 + 3 · ω2 + 3 · ω + 3, g6 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + 3 · ω3 + 3 · ω2 + 3 · ω + 2, 51 etc. The previous lemma can now be used to show that {gn} would be an inﬁnite decreasing sequence of ordinals. It is interesting that, although the statement of the theorem does not mention inﬁnity in any way, we used the Axiom of Inﬁnity in its proof. We do not need the Axiom of Inﬁnity in order to verify the theorem for any one particular value of x—we just need to carry out the arithmetic. The reader can do this for x = 4; however, ﬁnishing our example x = 54 would be tedious. Moreover, the calculations are somewhat diﬀerent for diﬀerent values of x. Mathematical logicians have proved that, in fact, there is no uniform method of ﬁnitary calculations which will give a proof of the theorem for all x. The Axiom of Inﬁnity is necessary for the proof. 52 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Chapter 6 Relations and Orderings In the following deﬁnitions, R and C are terms. 1. We say R is a relation on C whenever R ⊆C × C. 2. We say a relation R is irreﬂexive on C whenever ∀x ∈C ⟨x, x⟩/∈R. 3. We say a relation R is transitive on C whenever ∀x ∀y ∀z [(⟨x, y⟩∈R ∧⟨y, z⟩∈R) →⟨x, z⟩∈R.] 4.
