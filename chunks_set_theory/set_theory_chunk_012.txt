a = b. 40 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS Chapter 5 The Ordinal Numbers The natural number system can be extended to the system of ordinal num- bers. An ordinal is a transitive set of transitive sets. More formally: for any term t, “t is an ordinal” is an abbreviation for (t is transitive) ∧(∀x ∈t)(x is transitive). We often use lower case Greek letters to denote ordinals. We denote {α : α is an ordinal} by ON. From Theorem 6 we see immediately that N ⊆ON. Theorem 10. 1. ON is transitive. 2. ¬(∃z)(z = ON). Proof. 1. Let α ∈ON; we must prove that α ⊆ON. Let x ∈α; we must prove that 41 42 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS (a) x is transitive; and, (b) (∀y ∈x)(y is transitive). Clearly (a) follows from the deﬁnition of ordinal. To prove (b), let y ∈x; by transitivity of α we have y ∈α; hence y is transitive. 2. Assume (∃z)(z = ON). From (1) we have that ON is a transitive set of transitive sets, i.e., an ordinal. This leads to the contradiction ON ∈ON. Theorem 11. (Trichotomy of Ordinals) (∀α ∈ON)(∀β ∈ON)(α ∈β ∨β ∈α ∨α = β). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem 7. Because of this theorem, when α and β are ordinals, we often write α < β for α ∈β. Since N ⊆ON, it is natural to wonder whether N = ON. In fact, we know that “N = ON” can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms that we have stated (provided, of course, that those axioms are actually consistent). We ﬁnd ourselves at a crossroads in Set Theory. We can either add “N = ON” to our axiom system, or we can add “N ̸= ON”. As we shall see, the axiom “N = ON” essentially says that there are no inﬁnite sets and the axiom “N ̸= ON” essentially says that there are indeed inﬁnite sets. Of course, we go for the inﬁnite. The Axiom of Inﬁnity N ̸= ON 43 As a consequence, there is a set of all natural numbers; in fact, N ∈ON. Theorem 12. (∃z)(z ∈ON ∧z = N). Proof. Since N ⊆ON and N ̸= ON, pick α ∈ON\N. We claim that for each n ∈N we have n ∈α; in fact, this follows immediately from the trichotomy of ordinals and the transitivity of N. Thus N = {x ∈α : x ∈N} and by Comprehension ∃z z = {x ∈α : x ∈N}. The fact that N ∈ON now follows immediately from Theorem 6. The lower case Greek letter ω is reserved for the set N considered as an ordinal; i.e., ω = N. Theorems 6 and 12 now show that the natural numbers are the smallest ordinals, which are immediately succeeded by ω, after which the rest follow. The other ordinals are generated by two processes illustrated by the next lemma. Lemma. 1. ∀α ∈ON ∃β ∈ON β = succ(α). 2. ∀S [S ⊆ON →∃β ∈ON β = S S]. Exercise 7. Prove this lemma. For S ⊆ON we write sup S for the least element of {β ∈ON : (∀α ∈S)(α ≤β)} if such an element exists. Lemma. ∀S [S ⊆ON →S S = sup S] Exercise 8. Prove this lemma. An ordinal α is called a successor ordinal whenever ∃β ∈ON α = succ(β). If α = sup α, then α is called a limit ordinal. 44 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Lemma. Each ordinal is either a successor ordinal or a limit ordinal, but not both. Exercise 9. Prove this lemma. We can perform induction on the ordinals via a process called transﬁnite induction. In order to justify transﬁnite induction we need a the- orem scheme. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 13. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n ∈ON [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n ∈ON Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem scheme can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem Scheme 8. We can also carry out recursive deﬁnitions on ON. This process is called transﬁnite recursion. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, ON, ⃗w) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈ON)(∃f)[f : n →V∧f(x) = y∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. Transﬁnite recursion is justiﬁed by the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 14.
