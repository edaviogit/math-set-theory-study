APTER 13. APPENDICES 6. Intersection Axiom ∀x [x ̸= ∅→∃z z = {w : (∀y ∈x)(w ∈y)] 7. Axiom of Foundation ∀x [x ̸= ∅→(∃y ∈x)(x ∩y = ∅)] 8. Replacement Axiom Scheme For each formula Φ(x, u, v, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory, ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x [∀u ∈x ∃!v Φ →∃z z = {v : ∃u ∈x Φ}] 9. Axiom of Choice ∀X [(∀x ∈X ∀y ∈X (x = y ↔x∩y ̸= ∅)) →∃z (∀x ∈X ∃!y y ∈x∩z)] 10. Power Set Axiom ∀x ∃z z = {y : y ⊆x} 11. Axiom of Inﬁnity N ̸= ON .2 Tentative Axioms Here is a summary of potential axioms which we have discussed but which lie outside of ZFC. 1. Axiom of Inaccessibles ∃κ κ > ω and κ is an inaccessible cardinal 2. Continuum Hypothesis lP(ω)l = ω1 .2. TENTATIVE AXIOMS 119 3. Generalised Continuum Hypothesis ∀κ [κ is a cardinal →lP(κ)l = κ+ 4. Suslin Hypothesis Suppose that R is a complete dense linear order without endpoints in which every collection of disjoint intervals is countable. Then R ∼= R. 5. Axiom of Constructibility V = L.
