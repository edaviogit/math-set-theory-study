a relation on C whenever R ⊆C × C. 2. We say a relation R is irreﬂexive on C whenever ∀x ∈C ⟨x, x⟩/∈R. 3. We say a relation R is transitive on C whenever ∀x ∀y ∀z [(⟨x, y⟩∈R ∧⟨y, z⟩∈R) →⟨x, z⟩∈R.] 4. We say a relation R is well founded on C whenever ∀X [(X ⊆C ∧X ̸= ∅) →(∃x ∈X ∀y ∈X ⟨y, x⟩/∈R)]. Such an x is called minimal for X. 5. We say a relation R is total on C whenever ∀x ∈C ∀y ∈C [⟨x, y⟩∈R ∨⟨y, x⟩∈R ∨x = y]. 6. We say R is extensional on C whenever ∀x ∈C ∀y ∈C [x = y ↔∀z ∈C (⟨z, x⟩∈R ↔⟨z, y⟩∈R)]. 53 54 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS An example of a relation R on an ordinal is given by the membership relation: ⟨x, y⟩∈R iﬀx ∈y. R satisﬁes all the above properties. On the other hand, if α /∈ω, the reverse relation R′ given by ⟨x, y⟩∈R′ iﬀy ∈x is not well founded but nevertheless has all the other properties. Any well founded relation is irreﬂexive. Any total relation is extensional. Any relation which is both well founded and total is also transitive. Exercise 16. Prove that a transitive set α is an ordinal iﬀthe membership relation is total on α. Suppose δ is an ordinal and f : X →δ. A relation R on X with the property that f(x) < f(y) whenever ⟨x, y⟩∈R must be a well founded relation. In fact, this tums out to be a characterisation. Theorem 19. Let R be a relation on a set X. R is well founded iﬀthere is an ordinal δ and a surjection f : X →δ such that f(x) < f(y) whenever ⟨x, y⟩∈R. Proof. We treat only the forward implication. Using recursion on ON we deﬁne g : ON →P(X) by g(β) = n x : x is a minimal element of X \ [ {g(α) : α < β} o . From g we obtain f : X →ON by f(x) = ( the unique α ∈ON with x ∈g(α), if possible; 0, otherwise. By Theorem 10 and the Axiom of Replacement there must be some least δ ∈ON such that δ /∈mg(f). This means that g(δ) = ∅, and since R is well founded we must have X = [ {g(α) : α < δ}. 55 To ﬁnish the proof suppose ⟨x, y⟩∈R and f(y) = β. We have y ∈g(β) so that y is a minimal element of X \ [ {g(α) : α < β}, and hence we have that x /∈X \ [ {g(α : α < β}. In other words x ∈g(α) for some α < β and so f(x) = α < β = f(y). A relation R on a set A is said to be isomorphic to a relation S on a set B provided that there is a bijection f : A →B, called an isomorphism, such that for all x and y in A we have ⟨x, y⟩∈R iﬀ⟨f(x), f(y)⟩∈S. Exercise 17. Prove that any isomorphism between transitive sets is the identity. Of course, the relation on the transitive set is the membership relation, which is extensional and well founded. This unexpected result leads to the important Mostowski Collapsing The- orem. Theorem 20. Let R be a well founded extensional relation on a set X. There is a unique transitive set M and a unique isomorphism h : X →M. Proof. Obtain f : X →δ directly from the previous theorem. By recursion on the ordinals we deﬁne for each β < δ a function hβ : f ←{β} →V such that hβ(y) = {hα(x) : α < β and ⟨x, y⟩∈R}. Let h = S{hβ : β < δ}. Clearly h is a function with domain X. Note that if y ∈f ←{β} and ⟨x, y⟩∈R then x ∈f ←{α} for some α < β, so that in fact hβ(y) = {hα(x) : α < δ and ⟨x, y⟩∈R}, 56 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS and hence we have h(y) = {h(x) : ⟨x, y⟩∈R}. Since R is extensional, h is an injection. Letting M = mg(h), it is now straightforward to use the previous exercise to complete the proof. Exercise 18. Verify the last two sentences in this proof. We say that a relation R is a partial ordering or partial order whenever it is both irrefexive and transitive; if in addition it is total, then it is called a linear ordering or linear order; furthermore, if in addition it is well founded, then it is called a well ordering or well order. For those orderings we usually write < instead of R and we write x < y for ⟨x, y⟩∈R. Whenever ∃z z = ⟨X, <⟩and < is a partial ordering on X, we say that ⟨X, <⟩is a parially ordered set. We similarly have the concepts of linearly ordered set and well ordered set.
