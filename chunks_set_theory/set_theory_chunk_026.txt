= m. The set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), wi) if wi ∈X and ∅otherwise. 4. Again, without loss of generality, we assume j = m. This set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), G7(X, G6(X, {wi}))). 5. Again, assume j = m. This set is given by G3(Pm−1(X), G7(X, G5(X, {wi}))). 93 6. This time, assume i = m −1 and j = m. This set is G3(Pm−2(X), G4(X, X)). 7. We assume again that i = m −1 and j = m. This set becomes G3(Pm−2(X), G5(X, X)). For each formula Φ(x, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 44. Φ (∀⃗w)(∀X)(∃n ∈ω) [{x ∈X : ΦX(x, ⃗w)} = G(n,⃗s)] where ⃗s(i) = wi for i < k and s(k) = X. Proof. We prove by induction on the complexity of Φ that for all m ∈ω and Φ (∀⃗w)(∃n ∈ω)[{⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX(x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n,⃗s)] The proof of the theorem for any given Φ will assume the corresponding result for a ﬁnite number of simpler formulas, the proper subformulas of Φ. We begin by looking at atomic formulas Φ. This step is covered by the previous lemma. Now we proceed by induction on complexity. Suppose that {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX 1 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n1,⃗s) and {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX 2 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n2,⃗s). 94 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Then {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X . . . xm ∈X and ¬ΦX 1 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = Pm(X) \ G(n1,⃗s) = G2(Pm(X), G(n1,⃗s)) and {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X . . . xm ∈X and ΦX 1 ∧ΦX 2 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n1,⃗s) ∩G(n2,⃗s). The other connectives can be formed from ¬ and ∧; as such, ∀xl is ¬∃xl, so it only remains to do the Φ = ∃xl Φ1 step. Thanks again to the last lemma, we may assume that l = m. Then Φ is ∃xm Φ1 and {⟨x1 . . . xm−1⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm−1 ∈X and ΦX(x1, . . . , xm−1, ⃗w)} = G7(G(n1,⃗s)) Let’s write G(n, X, ⃗y) for G(n,⃗s), where ⃗s(0) = X and ⃗s(k + 1) = ⃗y(k) for all k ∈dom(⃗y) = dom(⃗s) −1. M is said to be an elementary submodel of N whenever 1. M ⊆N; and, 2. ∀k ∈ω ∀⃗y ∈ kM ∀n ∈ω G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅⇔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅. We write M ≺N. Justiﬁcation of the terminology comes from the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 45. Φ Suppose M ≺N. Then Φ is absolute between M and N. 95 Proof. We will use the Tarski-Vaught criterion. Let Φ0, . . . , Φm enumer- ate Φ and each of its subformulas. Suppose Φi is ∃x Φj(x, y0, . . . , yk) with y0, . . . , yk ∈M in a sequence ⃗y. Let n ∈ω so that by Theorem 44 we can ﬁnd n ∈ω such that G(n, N, ⃗y) = {x ∈N : ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk)}. Then ∃x ∈N ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk) ↔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅ ↔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅ ↔∃x ∈M ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk). The following is sometimes called the Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski theorem. Theorem 46. Suppose X ⊆N. Then there is an M such that 1. M ≺N; 2. X ⊆M; and, 3. lMl ≤max{ω, lXl}. Proof. Deﬁne F : ω × S{kN : k ∈ω} →N by choice: F(n,⃗s) = ( some element of G(n, N,⃗s) if G(n, N,⃗s) ̸= ∅ any element of N otherwise Now deﬁne {Xn}n∈ω by recursion on N as follows: X0 = X Xm+1 = Xm ∪F ′′(ω × [ {k(Xm) : k ∈ω}) 96 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Let M = S m∈ω Xm. As such, (2) and (3) are clearly satisﬁed. To check (1), let ⃗y ∈ k(Xm). If G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅, then F(n, ⃗y) ∈Xm+1 ⊆M and G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅. The use of elementary submodels of the H(θ) can be illustrated. Theorem 47. (Pressing Down Lemma) Let f : ω1 \ {0} →ω1 be regressive; i.e., f(α) < α for all α. Then ∃β ∈ω1 such that f ←{β} is uncountable. Theorem 48. (Delta System Lemma) Let A be an uncountable collection of ﬁnite sets. Then ∃D ⊆A ∃R such that 1. D is uncountable, and 2. ∀D1, D2 ∈D D1 ∩D2 = R. We need some lemmas. Assume M ≺H(θ) where θ is an uncountable regular cardinal. For each △0 formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk) we have: Lemma. Φ (∀y0 ∈M) . . . (∀yk ∈M) [M l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) ⇔Φ(y0, . . . , yk)]. Proof. M l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) ⇔H(θ) l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) by elementarity, ⇔Φ(y0, . . . , yk) since H(θ) is transitive. 97 Remark. The same is true for △T 1 formulas where T is ZFC without Power Set. For any formula Φ(v0, . . .
