natural numbers in our universe of set theory. We will construct a number system which behaves mathematically exactly like the natural numbers, with exactly the same arithmetic and order properties. We will not claim that what we construct are the actual natural numbers—whatever they are made of. But we will take the liberty of calling our constructs “the natural numbers”. We begin by taking 0 as the empty set ∅. We write 1 for {0} 2 for {0, 1} 3 for {0, 1, 2} succ(x) for x ∪{x} We write “n is a natural number” for [n = ∅∨(∃l ∈n)(n = succ(l))] ∧(∀m ∈n)[m = ∅∨(∃l ∈n)(m = succ(l))] and write: N for {n : n is a natural number} The reader can gain some familiarity with these deﬁnitions by checking that succ(n) ∈N for all n ∈N. 31 32 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We now begin to develop the basic properties of the natural numbers by introducing an important concept. We say that a term t is transitive whenever we have (∀x ∈t)(x ⊆t). Theorem 6. 1. Each natural number is transitive. 2. N is transitive; i.e., every element of a natural number is a natural number. Proof. Suppose that (1) were false; i.e., some n ∈N is not transitive, so that: {k : k ∈n and ¬(k ⊆n)} ̸= ∅. By Comprehension ∃x x = {k ∈n : ¬(k ⊆n)} and so by Foundation there is y ∈x such that y ∩x = ∅. Note that since ∅/∈x and y ∈n we have that y = succ(l) for some l ∈n. But since l ∈y, l /∈x and so l ⊆n. Hence y = l ∪{l} ⊆n, contradicting that y ∈x. We also prove (2) indirectly; suppose n ∈N with {m : m ∈n and m /∈N} ̸= ∅. By Comprehension ∃x x = {m ∈n : m /∈N} and so Foundation gives y ∈x such that y ∩x = ∅. Since y ∈n, we have y = succ(l) for some l ∈n. Since l ∈y and y ∩x = ∅we must have l ∈N. But then y = succ(l) ∈N, contradicting that y ∈x. Theorem 7. (Trichotomy of Natural Numbers) Let m, n ∈N. Exactly one of three situations occurs: m ∈n, n ∈m, m = n. Proof. That at most one occurs follows from Theorem 2. That at least one occurs follows from this lemma. 33 Lemma. Let m, n ∈N. 1. If m ⊆n, then either m = n or m ∈n. 2. If m /∈n, then n ⊆m. Proof. We begin the proof of (1) by letting S denote {x ∈N : (∃y ∈N)(y ⊆x and y ̸= x and y /∈x)}. It will suﬃce to prove that S = ∅. We use an indirect proof—pick some n1 ∈S. If n1 ∩S ̸= ∅, Foundation gives us n2 ∈n1 ∩S with n2 ∩(n1 ∩S) = ∅. By transitivity, n2 ⊆n1 so that n2 ∩S = ∅. Thus, we always have some n ∈S such that n ∩S = ∅. For just such an n, choose m ∈N with m ⊆n, m ̸= n, and m /∈n. Using Foundation, choose l ∈n \ m such that l ∩(n \ m) = ∅. Transitivity gives l ⊆n, so we must have l ⊆m. We have l ̸= m since l ∈n and m /∈n. Therefore we conclude that m \ l ̸= ∅. Using Foundation, pick k ∈m \ l such that k ∩(m \ l) = ∅. Transitivity of m gives k ⊆m and so we have k ⊆l. Now, because l ∈n we have l ∈N and l /∈S so that either k = l or k ∈l. However, k = l contradicts l /∈m and k ∈l contradicts k ∈m \ l. We prove the contrapositive of (2). Suppose that n is not a subset of m; using Foundation pick l ∈n \ m such that l ∩(n \ m) = ∅. By transitivity, l ⊆n and hence l ⊆m. Now by (1) applied to l and m, we conclude that l = m. Hence m ∈n. These theorems show that “∈” behaves on N just like the usual ordering “<” on the natural numbers. In fact, we often use “<” for “∈” when writing about the natural numbers. We also use the relation symbols ≤, >, and ≥ in their usual sense. 34 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS The next theorem scheme justiﬁes ordinary mathematical induction. For brevity let us write ⃗w for w1, . . . , wn. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 8. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n ∈N [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n ∈N Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. We will assume that the theorem is false and derive a contradiction. We have ⃗w and a ﬁxed l ∈N such that ¬Φ(l, ⃗w). Let t be any transitive subset of N containing l (e.g., t = l ∪{l}). By Comprehension, ∃s s = {n ∈t : ¬Φ(n, ⃗w)}. By Foundation, we get y ∈s such that y ∩s = ∅. Transitivity of t guarantees that (∀n ∈y) Φ(n, ⃗w).
