i = min {k ∈ω : xk /∈dom(fn)} and j is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving; and, 2. if n is odd, j = min {k ∈ω : yk /∈mg(fn)} and i is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving. We then check that for each n ∈ω, there is indeed a choice of j in (1) and i in (2) and that f = S{fn : n ∈ω} is an isomorphism. Any complete dense linear order without endpoints and with a countable dense subset is isomorphic to ⟨R, <⟩. Can “with a countable dense subset” be replaced by “in which every collection of disjoint intervals is countable”?. The aﬃrmation of this is called the Suslin Hypothesis. It is the second most important problem in Set Theory. It too requires new axioms for its solution. We have begun with N, extended to Z, then extended again to R. We now extend once more to ∗R. This is the set of hyperreals. In order to do this, we introduce the important notion of an ultraﬁlter. A collection of subsets U ⊆P(S) is a ﬁlter provided that it satisﬁes the ﬁrst three of the following conditions: 1. S ∈U and ∅/∈U. 68CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS 2. If A ∈U and B ∈U, then A ∩B ∈U. 3. If A ∈U and A ⊆B, then B ∈U. 4. A ∈U or B ∈U whenever A ∪B = S. 5. ∀x ∈S {x} /∈U. If a ﬁlter U obeys condition (4) it is called an ultraﬁlter, and if U satisﬁes conditions (1) through (5) it is said to be a free or non-principal ultraﬁlter. An ultraﬁlter is a maximal ﬁlter under inclusion. Every ﬁlter can be extended to an ultraﬁlter. (We can recursively deﬁne it.) There is a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Theorem 29. (Ramsey) If P : [ω]2 →{0, 1}, then there is H ∈[ω]ω such that lP ′′[H]2l = 1. Proof. Let U be a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Either: 1. {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 0} ∈U} ∈U; or, 2. {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 1} ∈U} ∈U. As such, the proof breaks into two similar cases. We address case (1). Let S = {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 0} ∈U}. Pick α0 ∈S and let S0 = {β ∈ω : P({α0, β}) = 0}. Pick α1 ∈S ∩S0 and let S1 = {β ∈ω : P({α1, β}) = 0}. In general, recursively choose {αn : n < ω} such that for each n αn+1 ∈S ∩S0 ∩· · · ∩Sn, 69 where Sn = {β ∈ω : P({αn, β}) = 0}. Then H = {αn : n < ω} exhibits the desired property. Theorem 30. (Sierpinski) There is a function P : [ω1]2 →{0, 1} such that there is no H ∈[ω1]ω1 with lP ′′[H]2l = 1. Proof. Let f : ω1 →R be an injection. Deﬁne P as follows: for α < β, let P({α, β}) = ( 0, if f(α) < f(β); 1, if f(α) > f(β). (8.1) The following exercise ﬁnishes the proof. Exercise 26. There is no subset of R with order type ω1. Let U be a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Form an equivalence relation ∼on ωR by the rule: f ∼g whenever {n ∈ω : f(n) = g(n)} ∈U. The equivalence class of f is denoted by [f] = {g ∈ ωR : g ∼f}. The set of equivalence classes of ∼is called the ultrapower of R with respect to U. The elements of ωR are often called the hyperreal numbers and denoted ∗R. There is a natural embedding of R into ∗R given by x 7→[fx] where fx : ω →R is the constant function; i.e., fx(n) = x for all n ∈ω; we identify R with its image under the natural embedding. 70CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS We can deﬁne an ordering ∗< on ∗R by the rule: a <∗b whenever ∃f ∈a ∃g ∈b {n ∈ω : f(n) < g(n)} ∈U. Lemma. ∗< is a linear ordering on ∗R which extends the usual ordering of R. Exercise 27. Prove this lemma. We usually omit the asterisk, writing < for ∗<. Exercise 28. There is a subset of ∗R of order type ω1. For each function F : Rn →R there is a natural extension ∗F : (∗R)n → ∗R given by ∗F(⃗a) = [F ◦⃗s] where ⃗a = ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩∈(∗R)n and ⃗s: ω →Rn such that for each j ∈ω ⃗s(j) = ⟨s0(j), . . . , sn−1(j)⟩ and si ∈ai for each i. Theorem 31. (The Leibniz Transfer Principle) Suppose F : Rn →R and G: Rn →R. 1. ∀⃗a ∈Rn F(⃗a) = G(⃗a) iﬀ∀⃗a ∈(∗R)n ∗F(⃗a) = ∗G(⃗a). 2. ∀⃗a ∈Rn F(⃗a) < G(⃗a) iﬀ∀⃗a ∈(∗R)n ∗F(⃗a) < ∗G(⃗a). Exercise 29. Prove the above theorem. This includes verifying that ∗F is a function. As a consequence of this theorem, we can extend + and × to ∗R.
