) = [ {L(α) : α < δ} for a limit ordinal δ We denote by L the class S{L(α) : α ∈ON}. Sets in L are said to be constructible. Lemma. For each ordinal α, L(α) ⊆R(α). Proof. This is proved by induction. L(0) = ∅= R(0) and for each α ∈ON we have, by deﬁnition, L(α + 1) ⊆P(L(α)) ⊆R(α + 1) 101 102 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. 1. ∀X X ⊆cl(X). 2. If X is transitive, then cl(X) is transitive. 3. For each ordinal α, L(α) is transitive. Proof. 1. For any w ∈X, w = G(1,⃗s), where ⃗s(0) = w. 2. Now, if z ∈cl(X) then z ⊆X so z ⊆cl(X). 3. This follows from (1) by induction on ON. Lemma. 1. For all ordinals α < β, L(α) ∈L(β). 2. For all ordinals α < β, L(α) ⊆L(β). Proof. 1. For each α, L(α) ∈L(α + 1) by Part (1) of the previous lemma. We then apply induction on β. 2. This follows from (1) by transitivity of L(β). Lemma. 1. For each ordinal β, β /∈L(β). 2. For each ordinal β, β ∈L(β + 1). 103 Proof. 1. This is proved by induction on β. The case β = 0 is easy. If β = α + 1 then β ∈L(α + 1) would imply that β ⊆L(α) and hence α ∈β ⊆L(α) contradicting the inductive hypothesis. If β is a limit ordinal and β ∈ L(β) then β ∈L(α) for some α ∈β and hence α ∈β ∈L(α), again a contradiction. 2. We employ induction on β. The β = 0 case is given by 0 ∈{0}. We do the sucessor and limit cases uniformly. Assume that ∀α ∈β α ∈L(α + 1). Claim 1. β = L(β) ∩ON. Proof of Claim 1. If α ∈β, then α ∈L(α + 1) ⊆L(β). If α ∈L(β), then α ∈β because otherwise α = β or β ∈α, which contradicts β /∈L(β) from (1). Claim 2. ∀x x ∈ON iﬀ [(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈u v ∈x) ∧(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈x (u ∈v ∨v ∈u ∨u = v)) ∧(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈x ∀w ∈x (u ∈v ∧v ∈w →u ∈w))]. Proof of Claim 2. The statement says that x is an ordinal iﬀx is a tran- sitive set and the ordering ∈on x is transitive and satisﬁes trichotomy. This is true since ∈is automatically well founded. The importance of this claim is that this latter formula, call it Φ(x), is △0 and hence absolute for transitive sets. We have: β = L(β) ∩ON = {x ∈L(β) : x is an ordinal} = {x ∈L(β) : Φ(x)} = {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β+1)(α)} ∈cl(L(β)) using Theorem 44 = L(β + 1). 104 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. 1. For each ordinal β, β = L(β) ∩ON. 2. ON ⊆L. Proof. This is easy from the previous lemmas. Lemma. 1. If W is a ﬁnite subset of X then W ∈cl(X). 2. If W is a ﬁnite subset of L(β) then W ∈L(β + 1). Proof. 1. We apply Theorem 44 to the formula “x = w0 ∨· · · ∨x = wn”, where W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. 2. This follows immediately from (1). Lemma. 1. If X is inﬁnite then lcl(X)l = lXl. 2. α ≥ω then lL(α)l = lαl. Proof. 1. By Theorem 44 we can construct an injection cl(X) →ω ×S{kX : k ∈ ω}. Hence, lXl ≤lcl(X)l ≤max (ℵ0, l{kX : k ∈ω}l) = lXl. 105 2. We proceed by induction, beginning with the case α = ω. We ﬁrst note that from the previous lemma, we have L(n) = R(n) for each n ∈ω. Therefore, lL(ω)l = l [ {L(n) : n ∈ω}l = max (ℵ0, sup {lL(n)l : n ∈ω}) = max (ℵ0, sup {lR(n)l : n ∈ω}) = ℵ0. For the successor case, lL(β + 1)l = lL(β)l by (1) = lβl by inductive hypothesis = lβ + 1l since β is inﬁnite . And if δ is a limit ordinal then lL(δ)l = l [ {L(β) : β ∈δ}l = max (lδl, sup {lL(β)l : β ∈δ}) = max (lδl, sup {l(β)l : β ∈δ}) by inductive hypothesis = lδl. Lemma. (∀x) [x ⊆L →(∃y ∈L)(x ⊆y)]. Proof. x ⊆L means that ∀u ∈x ∃α ∈ON x ∈L(α). By the Axiom of Replacement, ∃z z = {α : (∃u ∈x)(α is the least ordinal such that u ∈L(α))}. Let β = sup z; then β ∈ON and for each u ∈x, there is α ≤β such that u ∈L(α) ⊆L(β). Since L(β) ∈L(β + 1) ⊆L, we can take y = L(β). Remark. The above lemma is usually quoted as “L is almost universal”. 106 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. L l= V = L. Proof. This is not the trivial statement ∀x ∈L x ∈L but rather ∀x ∈L (x ∈L)L which is equivalent to (∀x ∈L)(∃α ∈ON x ∈L(α))L; which is, in tum, since ON ⊆L, equivalent to (∀x ∈L)(∃α ∈ON)(x ∈L(α))L. This latter statement is true since “x ∈L(α)” is a △0 formula when written out in full in LOST, and since L is transitive. For each Axiom Φ of ZFC we have: Theorem 50. Φ L l= Φ. Proof.
