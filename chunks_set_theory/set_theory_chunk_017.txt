here that y ̸= ∅. Theorem 24. (G. Cantor) ∀x lxl < lP(x)l. Proof. First note that if lxl ≥lP(x)l, then there would be a surjection g: x →P(x). But this cannot happen, since {a ∈x : a /∈g(a)} /∈g→(x). 61 For any ordinal α, we denote by α+ the least cardinal greater than α. This is well deﬁned by Theorem 24. Exercise 21. Prove the following: 1. The supremum of a set of cardinals is a cardinal. 2. ¬∃z z = {κ : κ is a cardinal}. Theorem 25. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, lκ × κl = κ. Proof. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. The formulas lκl = lκ × {0}l and lκ × {0}l ≤lκ × κl imply that κ ≤lκ × κl. We now show that lκ × κl ≤κ. We use induction and assume that lλ × λl = λ for each inﬁnite cardinal λ < κ. We deﬁne an ordering on κ × κ by: ⟨α0, β0⟩< ⟨α1, β1⟩iﬀ      max {α0, β0} < max {α1, β1}; max {α0, β0} = max {α1, β1} ∧α0 < α1; or, max {α0, β0} = max {α1, β1} ∧α0 = α1 ∧β0 < β1. It is easy to check that < well orders κ × κ. Let θ = type ⟨κ × κ, <⟩. It suﬃces to show that θ ≤κ. And for this it suﬃces to show that for all ⟨α, β⟩∈κ × κ, type ⟨<←{⟨α, β⟩}, <⟩< κ. To this end, pick ⟨α, β⟩∈κ×κ. Let δ ∈κ be such that <←{⟨α, β⟩} ⊆δ ×δ. This is possible since κ is a limit ordinal. It now suﬃces to prove that type ⟨<←{⟨δ, δ⟩}, <⟩< κ. By Theorem 23 it suﬃces to prove that l<←{⟨δ, δ⟩}l < κ and so it suﬃces to prove that lδ × δl < κ. Since lδ × δl = llδl × lδll, it suﬃces to prove that lλ × λl < κ for all cardinals λ < κ. If λ is inﬁnite, this is true by inductive hypothesis. If λ is ﬁnite, then lλ × λl < ω ≤κ. 62 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY Corollary. If X is inﬁnite, then lX × Y l = max {lXl, lY l}. Theorem 26. For any X we have l S Xl ≤max {lXl, sup {lal : a ∈X}}, provided that at least one element of X ∪{X} is inﬁnite. Proof. Let κ = sup {lal : a ∈X}. Using Exercise 20, for each a ∈X there is a surjection fa : κ →a. Deﬁne a surjection f : X × κ →S X by f(⟨a, α⟩) = fa(α). Using Exercise 20 and the previous corollary, the result follows. Deﬁne BA as {f : f : B →A} and [A]κ as {x : x ⊆A ∧lxl = κ}. Lemma. If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then lκκl = l[κ]κl = lP(κ)l. Proof. We have, κ2 ⊆ κκ ⊆[κ × κ]κ ⊆P(κ × κ). Using characteristic functions it is easily proved that lκ2l = lP(κ)l. Since lκ × κl = κ we have the result. Lemma. If κ ≤λ and λ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then lκλl = l[λ]κl. Proof. For each x ∈[λ]κ there is a bijection fx : κ →x. Since fx ∈ κλ, we have an injection from [λ]κ into κλ, so l[λ]κl ≤lκλl. Now κλ ⊆[κ × λ]κ. Thus, lκλl ≤l[λ]κl. A subset S of a limit ordinal α is said to be coﬁnal whenever sup S = α. A function f : δ →α is said to be coﬁnal whenever mg(f) is coﬁnal in α. The coﬁnality, cf(α), of a limit ordinal α is the least δ ∈ON such that there is a coﬁnal f : δ →α. 63 A cardinal κ is said to be regular whenever cf(κ) = κ. Otherwise, κ is said to be singular. These notions are of interest when κ is an inﬁnite cardinal. In particular, ω is regular. Lemma. 1. For each limit ordinal κ, cf(κ) is a regular cardinal. 2. For each limit ordinal κ, κ+ is a regular cardinal. 3. Each inﬁnite singular cardinal contains a coﬁnal subset of regular car- dinals. Exercise 22. Prove this lemma. Theorem 27. (K¨onig’s Theorem) For each inﬁnite cardinal κ, lcf(κ)κl > κ. Proof. We show that there is no surjection g: κ → δκ, where δ = cf(κ). Let f : δ →κ witness that cf(κ) = δ. Deﬁne h: δ →κ such that each h(α) /∈{g(β)(α) : β < f(α)}. Then h /∈g→(κ), since otherwise h = g(β) for some β < κ; pick α ∈δ such that f(α) > β. Corollary. For each inﬁnite cardinal κ, cf(lP(κ)l) > κ. Proof. Let λ = lP(κ)l. Suppose cf(λ) ≤κ. Then λ = lP(κ)l = lκ2l = l(κ×κ)2l = lκ(κ2)l = lκλl ≥lcf(λ)λl > λ. Cantor’s Theorem guarantees that for each ordinal α there is a set, P(α), which has cardinality greater than α. However, it does not imply, for exam- ple, that ω+ = lP(ω)l. This statement is called the Continuum Hypothesis, and is equivalent to the third question in the introduction. 64 CHAPTER 7.
