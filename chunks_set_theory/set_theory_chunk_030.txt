⊆M. Now let a ∈M. Since M l= V = L we have M l= ∀x ∃y ∈ON x ∈L(y) ⇒M l= ∃y ∈ON a ∈L(y) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) M l= a ∈L(α) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) a ∈L(α) ⇒a ∈L(o(M)). Lemma. χC If ON ⊆C, C is transitive, and ΦC L, then C = L. 110 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Proof. The proof is similar to that of the previous lemma. Theorem 51. (K. G¨odel) If V = L then GCH holds. Proof. We ﬁrst prove the following: Claim. ∀α ∈ON P(L(α)) ⊆L(α+). Proof of Claim. This is easy for ﬁnite α, since L(n) = R(n) for each n ∈ω. Let’s prove the claim for inﬁnite α ∈ON. Let X ∈P(L(α)); we will show that X ∈L(α+). Let A = L(α) ∪{X}. A is transitive and lAl = lαl. By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, there is a β ∈ON such that both A ⊆L(β) and L(β) l= ΦL, where ΦL is the formula introduced earlier. Now use the Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem to obtain an elementary submodel K ≺L(β) such that A ⊆K and lKl = lAl = lαl so by elementarily we have K l= ΦL. Now use the Mostowski Collapsing Theorem to get a transitive M such that K ∼= M. Since A is transitive, the isomorphism is the indentity on A and hence A ⊆M. We also get M l= ΦL and lMl = lαl. Now we use the penultimate lemma to infer that M = L(o(M)). Since lMl = lαl we have lo(M)l = lαl so that o(M) < lα+l. Hence A ⊆M = L(o(M)) ⊆L(α+), so that X ∈L(α+). We now see that the GCH follows from the claim. For each cardinal κ we have κ ⊆L(κ) so that lP(κ)l ≤lP(L(κ))l ≤lL(κ+). Since lL(κ+)l = κ+ we have lP(κ)l = κ+. 111 We now tum our attention to whether V = L is true. Let µ be a cardinal and let U be an ultraﬁlter over µ. Recalling that µV = {f : f : µ →V}, let ∼U be a binary relation on µV deﬁned by f ∼U g iﬀ{α ∈µ : f(α) = g(α)} ∈U. It is easy to check that ∼U is an equivalence relation. For each f ∈ µV let ρ(f) be the least element of {α ∈ON : rank(g) = α ∧f ∼U g}. Let [f] = {g ∈R(ρ(f) + 1) : g ∼U f} and let ULTU V = {[f] : f ∈ µV}. Deﬁne a relation ∈U on ULTU V by [f] ∈U [g] iﬀ{α ∈µ : f(α) ∈g(α)} ∈U. It is easy to check that ∈U is well deﬁned. For each cardinal κ, we use the abbreviation [X]<κ = {Y ⊆X : lY l < κ}. Given an uncountable cardinal κ, an ultraﬁlter U is said to be κ−complete if ∀X ∈[U]<κ T X ∈U. An uncountable cardinal κ is said to be measurable whenever there exists a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter over κ. Lemma. If U is a countably complete ultraﬁlter (in particular if U is a µ−complete ultraﬁlter) then ∈U is set-like, extensional and well founded. Proof. To see that ∈U is set-like, just note that {[g] : [g] ∈U [f]} ⊆R(ρ(f) + 2). For extentionality, suppose [f] ̸= [g]; i.e., {α ∈µ : f(α) = g(α)} /∈U. Then either {α ∈µ : ¬f(α) ⊆g(α)} ∈U or {α ∈µ : ¬g(α) ⊆f(α)} ∈U. This leads to two similar cases; we address the ﬁrst. 112 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Pick any h ∈ µV such that h(α) ∈f(α) \ g(α) whenever ¬f(α) ⊆g(α). Then [h] ∈U [f] and [h] ∈U [g]. To see that ∈U is well founded, suppose ∃{fn}n∈ω such that ∀n ∈ω [fn+1] ∈U [fn]. Let A = \ {{α ∈µ : fn+1(α) ∈fn(α)} : n ∈ω} ∈U. A ∈U by the countable completeness of U, so that A ̸= ∅. Pick any β ∈A. Then Fn+1(β) ∈fn(β) for each n ∈ω, which is a contradiction. We now create a Mostowski collapse of ULTU V hU : ULTU V →MU given by the recursion hU([f]) = {hU([g]) : [g] ∈U [f]} As per the Mostowski Theorem, h is an isomorphism and MU is transitive. The natural embedding iU : V →ULTU V is given by iU(x) = [fx] where fx : µ →V such that fx(α) = x for all α ∈µ. This natural embedding iU combines with the unique isomorphism hU to give jU : V →MU given by jU(x) = hU(iU(x)). jU is called the elementary embedding generated by U, since for all for- mulas Φ(v0, . . . , vn) of LOST we have: Lemma. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔ΦMU(jU(v0), . . . , jU(vn)). Proof. This follows from two claims, each proved by induction on the com- plexity of Φ. 113 Claim 1. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔¯Φ(iU(v0), . . . , iU(vn)). Claim 2. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ¯Φ(iU(v0), . . . , iU(vn)) ↔ΦMU(jU(v0), . . . , jU(vn)), where ¯Φ is Φ with ∈replaced by ∈U and all quantiﬁers restricted to ULTU V.
