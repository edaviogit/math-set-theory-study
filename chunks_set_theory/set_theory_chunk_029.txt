ON)(x ∈L(α))L. This latter statement is true since “x ∈L(α)” is a △0 formula when written out in full in LOST, and since L is transitive. For each Axiom Φ of ZFC we have: Theorem 50. Φ L l= Φ. Proof. Transitivity of L automatically gives Equality, Extensionality, Exis- tence and Foundation. We get Inﬁnity since ω ∈L and “z = N” is a △0 formula. For Comprehension, let Φ be any formula of LOST; we wish to prove ∀y ∈L ∀w0 ∈L . . . ∀wn ∈L ∃z ∈L z = {x ∈y : ΦL(x, y, w0, . . . , wn)} since L is transitive. Fix y, w0, . . . , wn and α ∈ON such that {y, ⃗w} ⊆L(α). By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, there is some β > α such that Φ is absolute between L and L(β). By Theorem 44, there is an n ∈ω such that G(n, L(β), y, ⃗w) = {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x, y, ⃗w)}. 107 and so by deﬁnition, {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 1). Now by absoluteness, {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x)} = {x ∈L(β)ΦL(x)}. So we have {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 1). Moreover, since y ∈L(β + 1), {x ∈y : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} = y ∩{x ∈L(β + 1) : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 2) and since L(β + 2) ⊆L we are done. For the Power Set Axiom, we must prove that (∀x ∃z z = {y : y ⊆x})L. That is, ∀x ∈L ∃z ∈L z = {y : y ∈L and y ⊆x}. Fix x ∈L; by the Power Set Axiom and the Axiom of Comprehension we get ∃z′ z′ = {y ∈P(x) : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} = {y : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x}. By the previous lemma L is almost universal and z′ ⊆L so ∃z′′ ∈L z′ ⊆z′′. So z′ = z′ ∩z′′ = {y ∈z′′ : y ∈L ∩y ⊆x}. By the fact that the Axiom of Comprehension holds relativised to L we get (∃z z = {y ∈z′′ : y ⊆x})L; i.e., ∃z ∈L z = {y ∈z′′ : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} = {y : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} The Union Axiom and the Replacement Scheme are treated similarly. To prove (the Axiom of Choice) L, we will show that the Axiom of Choice follows from the other axioms of ZFC with the additional assumption that V = L. It suﬃces to prove that for each α ∈ON there is a β ∈ON and a surjection fα : bα →L(α). 108 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY To do this we deﬁne fα recursively. Of course f0 = β0 = ∅= L(0). If α is a limit ordinal, then we let βα = X {βϵ : ϵ < α} and fα(σ) = fδ(τ) where σ = P{βϵ : ϵ < δ} + τ and τ < βδ. If α = γ + 1 is a successor ordinal, use fγ to generate a well ordering of L(γ) and use this well ordering to generate a lexicographic well ordering of S{k(L(γ)) : k ∈ω} and use this to obtain an ordinal ¯βα and a surjection ¯fγ : ¯βγ → [ {k(L(γ)) : k ∈ω}. Now let βα = βγ+1 = ¯βγ × ω and let fα : βα →L(α) = {G(n, L(α), ⃗y) : n ∈ω and ∃k ∈ω ⃗y ∈k L(γ)} be deﬁned by fα(σ) = G(n, L(γ), ¯fγ(τ)) where σ = ¯βγ × n + τ, τ < ¯βγ. This completes the proof of Theorem 50 Φ and motivates calling “V = L” the Axiom of Constructibility. Remark. V = L is consistent with ZFC in the sense that no ﬁnite subcollec- tion of ZFC can possibly prove V ̸= L; To see this, suppose {Ψ0, . . . , Ψn} ⊢V ̸= L. Then ΨL 0, . . . , ΨL n} ⊢(V ̸= L)L. by Theorem 50. This contradicts the preceding lemma. Remark. Assuming V = L we actually can ﬁnd a formula Ψ(x, y) which gives a well ordering of the universe. We denote by ΦL the conjunction of a ﬁnite number of axioms of ZFC conjoined with “V = L” such that ΦL implies all our lemmas and theorems about ordinals and ensures that x ∈L(α) is equivalent to some △0 formula 109 (but I think we have already deﬁned it to be △0). In particular, x ∈ON will be equivalent to a △0 formula. Furthermore, we explicitly want ΦL to imply that ∀α ∈ON ∃z z = L(α) and that there is no largest ordinal. We shall use the abbreviation o(M) = ON ∩M. Lemma. ∀M(M is transitive and ΦM L →M = L(o(M))). Proof. Let M be transitive such that M l= ΦL. Note that o(M) ∈ON. We have M l= ∀α ∈ON ∃z z = L(α). So, ∀α ∈o(M) M l= ∃z z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) ∃z ∈M M l= z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) ∃z ∈M z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) L(α) ∈M ⇒∀α ∈o(M) L(α) ⊆M. Since M l= ΦL, o(M) is a limit ordinal and hence L(o(M)) = [ {L(α) : α ∈o(M)} ⊆M. Now let a ∈M. Since M l= V = L we have M l= ∀x ∃y ∈ON x ∈L(y) ⇒M l= ∃y ∈ON a ∈L(y) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) M l= a ∈L(α) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) a ∈L(α) ⇒a ∈L(o(M)). Lemma. χC If ON ⊆C, C is transitive, and ΦC L, then C = L.
