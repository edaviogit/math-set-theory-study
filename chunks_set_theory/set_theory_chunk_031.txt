We leave the proofs to the reader. Theorem 52. Every measurable cardinal is inaccessible. Proof. We ﬁrst prove that κ is regular. If cf(κ) = λ < κ, then κ is the union of λ sets each smaller than κ. This contradicts the existence of a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter over κ. We now prove that if λ < κ, then lP(λ)l < κ. Suppose not; then there is X ∈[P(λ)]κ and a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter U over X. Now, for each α ∈λ let Aα = {x ∈X : α ∈x} and Bα = {x ∈X : α /∈x}. Let I = {α ∈λ : Aα ∈U} and J = {α ∈λ : Bα ∈U}. Since U is an ultraﬁlter, I ∪J = λ. Since U is κ−complete and λ < κ we have \ {Aα : α ∈I} ∩ \ {Bα : α ∈J} ∈U. But this intersection is equal to X ∪{I}, which is either empty or a singleton, contradicting that U is a free ﬁlter. Lemma. Let U be a µ−complete ultraﬁlter over an measurable cardinal µ. Let M = MU, h = hU, i = iU and j = jU as above. Then for each β ∈ON we have j(β) ∈ON and j(β) ≥β. Furthermore, if β < µ then j(β) = β and j(µ) > µ. Proof. For each β ∈ON we get, by the elementary embedding property of j, that M l= j(β) ∈ON; since M is transitive, j(β) ∈ON. Let β be the least ordinal such that j(β) ∈β. Then M l= j(j(β)) ∈j(β) by elementarity, and j(j(β)) ∈j(β) by transitivity of M. This contradicts the minimality of β. 114 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Now let’s prove that j(β) = β for all β < µ by induction on β. Suppose that j(γ) = γ for all γ < β < µ. We have j(β) = h(i(β)) = {h([g]) : [g] ∈U i(β)} = {h([g]) : [g] ∈U [fβ]} where fβ(α) = β for all α ∈µ = {h([g]) : {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈fβ(α)} ∈U} = {h([g]) : {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈β} ∈U} = {h([g]) : ∃γ ∈β {α ∈µ : g(α) = γ} ∈U} by µ −completeness of U = {h([g]) : ∃γ ∈β [g] = [fγ]} where fγ(α) = γ for all α ∈µ = {h([fγ]) : γ ∈β} = {h(i(γ)) : γ ∈β} = {j(γ) : γ ∈β} = {γ : γ ∈β} by inductive hypothesis Hence j(β) = β. We now show that j(µ) > µ. Let g: µ →ON such that g(α) = α for each α. We will show that β ∈h([g]) for each β ∈µ and that h([g]) ∈j(µ). Let β ∈µ. {α ∈µ : fβ(α) ∈g(α)} = {α ∈µ : β ∈α} = µ \ (β + 1) ∈U Hence [fβ] ∈U [g] and so h([fβ]) ∈h([g]). But since β ∈µ, β = j(β) = h(i(β)) = h([f(β)]) Hence β ∈h([g]). Now, {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈fµ(α)} = {α ∈µ : α ∈µ} = µ ∈U. Hence [g] ∈U [fµ] and so h[g] ∈h([fµ]) = h(i(µ)) = j(µ). 115 Theorem 53. (D. Scott) If V = L then there are no measurable cardinals. Proof. Assume that V = L and that µ is the least measurable cardinal; we derive a contradiction. Let U be a µ−complete ultraﬁlter over µ and consider j = jU and M = MU as above. Since V = L we have ΦL and by elementarity of j we have ΦM L . Note that ΦL is a sentence; i.e., it has no free variables. Since M is transitive, ON ⊆M by the previous lemma. So, by an earlier lemma M = L. So we have L = V l= (µ is the least measurable cardinal) and L = M l= (j(µ) is the least measurable cardinal). Thus L l= j(µ) = µ; i.e., j(µ) = µ, contradicting the previous theorem. Remark. We have demonstrated the existence of an elementary embedding j : V →M. K. Kunen has shown that there is no elementary j : V →V. Large cardinal axioms are often formulated as embedding axioms. For example, κ is said to be supercompact whenever ∀λ ∃j [j : V →M and j(κ) > λ and jlR(λ) = idlR(λ) and λM ⊆M]. 116 CHAPTER 12.
