hing is an element of itself so that {x : x /∈x} = {x : x = x} = V 22 CHAPTER 2. FOUND and so Russell’s paradox leads to: ¬∃z z = V. It seems we have proved that the universe does not exists. A pity. The mathematical universe fails to have a mathematical existence in the same way that the physical universe fails to have a physical existence. The things that have a physical existence are exactly the things in the universe, but the universe itself is not an object in the universe. This does bring up an important point—do any of the usual mathematical objects exist. What about the other things we described as classes. What about ∅. Can we prove that ∅exists. Actually, we can’t; at least not yet. You can’t prove very much, if you don’t assume something to start. We could prove Russell’s Paradox because, amazingly, it only required the basic rules of logic and required nothing mathematical—that is, nothing about the “real meaning” of ∈. Continuing from Russell’s Paradox to “¬∃z z = V” required us to assume that “∀x x /∈ x”—not an unreasonable assumption by any means, but a mathematical assumption none the less. The existence of the empty set “∃z z = ∅” may well be another necessary assumption. Generally set theorists, and indeed all mathematicians, are quite willing to assume anything which is obviously true. It is, after all, only the things which are not obviously true which need some form of proof. The problem, of course, is that we must somehow know what is “obviously true”. Naively, “∃z z = V” would seem to be true, but it is not and if it or any other false statement is assumed, all our proofs become infected with the virus of inconsistency and all of our theorems become suspect. Historically, considerable thought has been given to the construction of the basic assumptions for set theory. All of mathematics is based on these assumptions; they are the foundation upon which everything else is built. These assumptions are called axioms and this system is called the ZFC Axiom System. We will begin to study it in the next chapter. Chapter 3 The Axioms of Set Theory We will explore the ZFC Axiom System. Each axiom should be “obviously true” in the context of those things that we desire to call sets. Because we cannot give a mathematical proof of a basic assumption, we must rely on intuition to determine truth, even if this feels uncomfortable. Beyond the issue of truth is the question of consistency. Since we are unable to prove that our assumptions are true, can we at least show that together they will not lead to a contradiction. Unfortunately, we cannot even do this—it is ruled out by the famous incompleteness theorems of K. G¨odel. Intuition is our only guide. We begin. We have the following axioms: The Axiom of Equality ∀x ∀y [x = y →∀z (x ∈z ↔y ∈z)] The Axiom of Extensionality ∀x ∀y [x = y ↔∀u (u ∈x ↔u ∈y)] The Axiom of Existence ∃z z = ∅ The Axiom of Pairing ∀x ∀y ∃z z = {x, y} Diﬀerent authors give slightly diﬀerent formulations of the ZFC axioms. All formulations are equivalent. Some authors omit the Axiom of Equality and Axiom of Existence because they are consequences of the usual logical background to all mathematics. We include them for emphasis. Redundancy is not a bad thing and there is considerable redundancy in this system. 23 24 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY The following theorem gives some results that we would be quite willing to assume outright, were they not to follow from the axioms. The ﬁrst three parts are immediate consequences of the Axiom of Extensionality. Theorem 1. 1. ∀x x = x. 2. ∀x ∀y x = y →y = x. 3. ∀x ∀y ∀z [(x = y ∧y = z) →x = z]. 4. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = ⟨x, y⟩. 5. ∀u ∀v ∀x ∀y [⟨u, v⟩= ⟨x, y⟩↔(u = x ∧v = y)]. Exercise 1. Prove parts (4) and (5) of Theorem 1 We now assert the existence of unions and intersections. No doubt the reader has experienced a symmetry between these two concepts.
