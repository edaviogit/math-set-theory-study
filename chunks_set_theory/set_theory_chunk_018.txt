ater than α. However, it does not imply, for exam- ple, that ω+ = lP(ω)l. This statement is called the Continuum Hypothesis, and is equivalent to the third question in the introduction. 64 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY The aleph function ℵ: ON →ON is deﬁned as follows: ℵ(0) = ω ℵ(α) = sup {ℵ(β)+ : β ∈α}. We write ℵα for ℵ(α). We also sometimes write ωα for ℵ(α). The beth function ℶ: ON →ON is deﬁned as follows: ℶ(0) = ω ℶ(α) = sup {lP(ℶ(β))l : β ∈α}. We write ℶβ for ℶ(β). It is apparent that ℵ1 ≤ℶ1. The continuum hypothesis is the statement ℵ1 = ℶ1; this is abbreviated as CH. The generalised continuum hypothesis, GCH, is the statement ∀α ∈ON ℵα = ℶα. Exercise 23. Prove that ∀κ [κ is an inﬁnite cardinal →(∃α ∈ON(κ = ℵα)]. A cardinal κ is said to be inaccessible whenever both κ is regular and ∀λ < κ lP(λ)l < κ. An inaccessible cardinal is sometimes said to be strongly inaccessible, and the term weakly inaccesible is given to a regular cardinal κ such that ∀λ < κ λ+ < κ. Under the GCH these two notions are equivalent. Axiom of Inaccessibles ∃κ κ > ω and κ is an inaccessible cardinal This axiom is a stronger version of the Axiom of Inﬁnity, but the mathemat- ical community is not quite ready to replace the Axiom of Inﬁnity with it just yet. In fact, the Axiom of Inacessibles is not included in the basic ZFC axiom system and is therefore always explicitly stated whenever it is used. Exercise 24. Are the following two statements true. What if κ is assumed to be a regular cardinal. 1. κ is weakly inaccessible iﬀκ = ℵκ. 2. κ is strongly inaccesssible iﬀκ = ℶκ. Chapter 8 There Is Nothing Real About The Real Numbers We now formulate three familiar number systems in the language of set the- ory. From the natural numbers we shall construct the integers; from the integers we shall construct the decimal numbers and the real numbers. For each n ∈N let −n = {{m} : m ∈n}. The integers, denoted by Z, are deﬁned as Z = N ∪{−n : n ∈N}. For each n ∈N \ {∅} we denote {n} by −n. We can extend the ordering < on N to Z by letting x < y iﬀone of the following holds: 1. x ∈N ∧y ∈N ∧x < y; 2. x /∈N ∧y ∈N; or, 3. x /∈N ∧y /∈N ∧S y < S x. To form the reals, ﬁrst let F = {f : f ∈ ωZ}. 65 66CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS We pose a few restrictions on such functions as follows. Let us write: A(f) for (∀n > 0)(−9 ≤f(n) ≤9); B(f) for (∀n ∈ω)(f(n) ≥0) ∨(∀n ∈ω)(f(n) ≤0); C(f) for (∀m ∈ω)(∃n ∈ω \ m)(f(n) /∈{9, −9}); and, D(f) for (∃m ∈ω)(∀n ∈ω \ m)(f(n) = 0). Finally, let R = {f : f ∈F and A(f) and B(f) ∧C(f)} to obtain the real numbers and let D = {f : f ∈R and D(f)} to obtain the decimal numbers. We now order R as follows: let f < g iﬀ (∃n ∈ω) [f(n) < g(n) ∧(∀m ∈n)(f(m) = g(m))]. This ordering clearly extends our ordering on N and Z, and restricts to D. In light of these deﬁnitions, the operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation deﬁned in Chapter 4 can be formally extended from N to Z, D and R in a natural—if cumbersome—fashion. Lemma. 1. lDl = ℵ0. 2. R is uncountable. 3. < is a linear order on D. 4. (∀p ∈R)(∀q ∈R) [p < q →∃d ∈D p < d < q]. I.e., D is a countable dense subset of R. 5. < is complete; i.e., bounded subsets have suprema and inﬁma. Exercise 25. Prove this lemma. Theorem 28. Any two countable dense linear orders without endpoints are isomorphic. 67 Proof. This method of proof, the back-and-forth argument, is due to G.Cantor. The idea is to deﬁne an isomorphism recursively in ω steps, such that at each step we have an order-preserving ﬁnite function; at even steps f(xi) is deﬁned and at odd steps f −1(yj) is deﬁned. Precisely, if X = {xi : i ∈ω} and Y = {yj : j ∈ω} are two countable dense linear orders we deﬁne f : X →Y by the formulas f0 = {⟨x0, y0⟩} fn+1 = fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} where 1. if n is even, i = min {k ∈ω : xk /∈dom(fn)} and j is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving; and, 2. if n is odd, j = min {k ∈ω : yk /∈mg(fn)} and i is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving.
