(∃t ∈y)(∃q)[q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩} ∧p ∈q]} = {p : (∃t ∈y)p ∈{v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}} = {p : (∃t ∈y)(∃u ∈x) p = ⟨u, t⟩} = x × y 27 Exercise 4. Show that the Intersection Axiom is indeed redundant. It is natural to believe that for any set x, the collection of those elements y ∈x which satisfy some particular property should also be a set. Again, no tricks—the property should be speciﬁed by a formula of the language of set theory. Since this should hold for any formula, we are again led to a scheme. The Comprehension Scheme For each formula Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory, we have the statement: ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x ∃z z = {y : y ∈x ∧Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wn)} This scheme could be another axiom scheme (and often is treated as such). However, this would be unnecessary, since the Comprehension Scheme follows from what we have already assumed. It is, in fact, a theorem scheme—that is, inﬁnitely many theorems, one for each formula of the language of set theory. Of course we cannot write down inﬁnitely many proofs, so how can we prove this theorem scheme. We give a uniform method for proving each instance of the scheme. So to be certain that any given instance of the theorem scheme is true, we consider the uniform method applied to that particular instance. We give this general method below. For each formula Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 4. Φ ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x ∃z z = {u : u ∈x ∧Φ}. Proof. Apply Replacement with the formula Ψ(x, u, v, w1, . . . , wn) given by: (Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) →v = {u}) ∧(¬Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) →v = ∅) to obtain: ∃y y = {v : (∃u ∈x)[(Φ →v = {u}) ∧(¬Φ →v = ∅)]}. 28 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY Note that {{u} : Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn)} ⊆y and the only other possible element of y is ∅. Now let z = S y to ﬁnish the proof. Theorem 4 Φ can be thought of as inﬁnitely many theorems, one for each Φ. The proof of any one of those theorems can be done in a ﬁnite number of steps, which invoke only a ﬁnite number of theorems or axioms. A proof cannot have inﬁnite length, nor invoke inﬁnitely many axioms or lemmas. We state the last of the “set behavior” axioms. The Axiom of Choice ∀X [(∀x ∈X ∀y ∈X (x = y ↔x ∩y ̸= ∅)) →∃z (∀x ∈X ∃!y y ∈x ∩z)] In human language, the Axiom of Choice says that if you have a collection X of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets, then you get a set z which contains one element from each set in the collection. Although the axiom gives the existence of some “choice set” z, there is no mention of uniqueness—there are quite likely many possible sets z which satisfy the axiom and we are given no formula which would single out any one particular z. The Axiom of Choice can be viewed as a kind of replacement, in which each set in the collection is replaced by one of its elements. This leads to the following useful reformulation which will be used in Theorem 22. Theorem 5. There is a choice function on any set of non-empty sets; i.e., ∀X [∅/∈X →(∃f)(f : X → [ X ∧(∀x ∈X)(f(x) ∈x))]. Proof. Given such an X, by Replacement there is a set Y = {{x} × x : x ∈X} which satisﬁes the hypothesis of the Axiom of Choice. So, ∃z ∀y ∈Y ∃!p p ∈ y ∩z. Let f = z ∩(S Y ). Then f : X →S X and each f(x) ∈x. 29 We state the last of the “set creation” axioms. The Power Set Axiom ∀x ∃z z = {y : y ⊆x} We denote {y : y ⊆x} by P(x), called the power set of x. For reasons to be understood later, it is important to know explicitly when the Power Set Axiom is used. This completes the list of the ZFC Axiom System with one exception to come later—higher analogues of the Axiom of Existence. 30 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY Chapter 4 The Natural Numbers We now construct the natural numbers. That is, we will represent the natural numbers in our universe of set theory. We will construct a number system which behaves mathematically exactly like the natural numbers, with exactly the same arithmetic and order properties.
