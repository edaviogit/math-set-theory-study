All mathematical concepts are defined in terms of the primitive notions of set and membership. In axiomatic set theory we formulate  few simple axioms about these primitive notions in an attempt to capture the basic “obviously true” set-theoretic principles. From such axioms, all known mathematics may be derived. However, there are some questions which the axioms fail to settle, and that failure is the subject of this book. §1. Consistency results The specific axiom system we discuss is ZFC, or Zermelo—Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice. We say that  statement ¢ is independent of ZFC if neither @ nor 7@ (the negation of ¢) is provable from ZFC; this is equivalent to saying that both ZFC + 1@ and ZFC + ¢ are con- sistent. The most famous example of such  @ is the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), but within the past few years,  large number of statements, coming from various branches of mathematics, have been shown to be independent of ZFC. In this book, we study the techniques for showing that  statement ¢ is consistent with ZFC. @ will be shown to be independent if we can success- fully apply these techniques to @ and to 4; this will always involve two separate arguments. There are also many statements which have been shown to be consistent but whose independence has remained unsettled. Some of the statements known to be consistent with ZFC are “quotable” principles of abstract set theory, such as CH, or CH, or Martin’ Axiom, or Suslin’ Hypothesis, or ©. Workers in the more abstract areas of analysis and topology are well aware of these principles and often apply them. Since any consequence of  consistent statement is also consistent, this provides  source for many consistency proofs in mathematics. In addition, those mathematicians with  background in set theory often retum to the basic methods to prove consistency results for specific mathematical statements which do not follow from one of the known “quotable” principles. xi === 第1O页 === xii Introduction The purpose of this book is to explain the basic techniques for proving statements consistent with ZFC. We include consistency proofs for many of the “quotable” principles. More importantly, we hope to enable mathe- maticians to produce new consistency proofs of their own, as needed. §2. Prerequisites We assume that the reader has seen  development of axiomatic set theory through the basic properties of von Neumann ordinals and cardinals. This material is contained in set theory texts such as [Enderton 1977] or [Halmos 196O], as well as in appendices to books in other areas of mathe- matics which use set theory, such as [Chang-Keisler 1973] or [Kelley 1955]. This material is also reviewed in Chapter . It is not necessary for the reader to have seen the particular axiom system ZFC. There are other systems which differ from ZFC in the formal way proper classes are handled (see  §12).  reader familiar with one of these should have no trouble with ZFC, but should bear in mind that in ZFC proper classes have no formal existence, and all variables range over sets. The reader need not be knowledgeable about very picky axiomatic questions—such as which axioms of ZFC are used to prove which theorems. In those few cases where such questions are of any importance, they are reviewed quite extensively in Chapter 1. However, we do presume some sophistication in the way set theory is handled in its mathematical applica- tions, as one would see in  course in general topology or measure theory. Our prerequisite in formal logic is elastic.  book whose main results involve consistency of axiomatic systems cannot avoid logic entirely. We have included  sketch of background material on formal logic to enable readers with no training in the subject to understand independence proofs, but such readers might be suspicious about the complete mathematical rigor of our methods.  good undergraduate course in logic would dispel that suspicion. On  higher level, there are many foundational questions raised by our subject which are of interest to the student of logic per se, and we have collected such material in appendices to the various chapters. In these appendices, we have felt free to assume as much logical sophistica- tion as is needed for the particular argument at hand. §3. Outline Chapter  contains some logical background and  sketch of the develop- ment of the axioms of ZFC, excluding Foundation (Regularity). Since this material is partly  review, we have omitted many proofs. We have been === 第11页 === Introduction xiii fairly pedantic about the fact that for many of the theorems, certain axioms, especially Choice and Power Set, are not needed, and we have indicated explicitly where these axioms are used; such considerations are not impor- tant for the development of mathematics within ZFC, but will be useful when we get to independence proofs. Chapter II covers some special topics in combinatorial set theory. In part, this chapter provides some combinatorial lemmas needed in Chapters VI-VIII, but its main purpose is to introduce the reader to the vast array of set-theoretic questions that one might try to prove independent of ZFC. We have departed from tradition in basing our treatment of forcing in Chapter VII upon the discussion of Martin’ Axiom in Chapter II. This has the advantage of separating the mathematical difficulties in handling forcing from the metamathematical ones. It has the disadvantage of re- quiring those readers (if there are any) who wish to leam forcing without leaming Martin’ Axiom to do some extra work. The Axiom of Foundation is discussed in Chapter III. This axiom is never used in mathematics, but it leads to  much clearer picture of the set theoretic universe. Chapter IV develops the basic methods used in producing consistency proofs, including inner models, relativization, and absoluteness. We also discuss the Reflection Theorem and related results. Chapter  discusses the formalization of the logical notion of definability within ZFC. These ideas are used in defining the class  of constructible sets in Chapter VI. In Chapter VI we establish the consistency of the Gener- alized Continuum Hypothesis by showing that it holds in . We also show that the combinatorial principles } and ©* are true in . Chapter VII introduces forcing and uses it to prove the consistency of CH and various related statements of cardinal arithmetic. Chapter VIII covers iterated forcing and the consistency of Martin’ Axiom with —CH. §4. How to use this book In intemal cross referencing, chapters are denoted by Roman numerals and § denotes section number. Thus, VII §5 is the fifth section of Chapter Seven, and VII 5.16 is the sixteenth numbered enunciation in that section. The exercises range from routine verifications to additional development of the material in the chapter. The more difficult ones are starred. The exercises are not necessary for understanding later material in the text, although they are sometimes required for later exercises. There are probably more exercises in some of the chapters than most readers will want to do. It is not necessary to read the book straight through from cover to cover. In particular, the material in Chapter II is not used at all until the end of === 第12页 === xiv Introduction Chapter VI, so the reader may simply skip Chapter II and refer back to it as needed. Also,  knowledge of constructibility is not necessary to under- stand forcing, so it is possible to read Chapters VII and VIII without reading Chapters  and VI, although the reader doing this would have to take on faith the existence of models of GCH. Furthermore, the appendices of all chapters may be omitted without loss of continuity. §5. What has been omitted We have two goals in writing this book. First, we hope to bridge the gap between the current literature and the elementary texts on cardinals and ordinals. Second, we hope to emphasize the interplay between classical combinatorial set theory and modem independence proofs. Much important material in set theory which is secondary to these goals has been omitted. Specifically, topics which are already well covered in the literature by texts or survey articles have often been omitted. We have little here on large cardinals: the interested reader may consult [Drake 1974] or [Solovay— Reinhardt-Kanamori 1978]. Likewise, we do not treat the fine-structure methods in ; see [Devlin 1973] for this. We have also avoided topics which require some sophistication in logic. In particular, we do not discuss model-theoretic applications of large cardinals (see [Drake 1974]), or results in descriptive set theory, or the relationship between these fields (see [Martin 1977] or [Moschovakis 198O}). st book gives short shrift to the Axiom of Choice (AC). We consider AC to be one of the basic axioms of set theory, although we do indicate proofs that it is neither provable (see VII Exercise E4) nor refutable (see  2.14 and VI 4.9) from the other axioms. For more on set theory without AC, see [Jech 1973]. §6. On references Since this is  text and not  research monograph, we have not attempted to give references to the literature for every theorem we prove. Our bibliog- raphy is intended primarily as suggestions for further reading, and not as  source for establishing priority. We apologize to those mathematicians who are chagrined at not seeing their name mentioned more often. Aside from  few trivial exercises, none of the results in this book are due to the author. === 第13页 === Introduction xv §7. The axioms For reference, we list here the axioms of ZFC and of some related theories; these are explained in much greater detail in Chapters  and III. After each axiom we list the section in Chapters  or III where it first occurs. Axiom O. Set Existence ( §5). dx ( = ). Axiom |. Extensionality (1 §5).  Wy (Wz (zexerzey) + =»). Axiom 2.

On the basis of Axioms O, 1,3,4,5 and 6, one may define < (subset), O (empty set),  (ordinal successor; () =  {}),and the notion of well- ordering. The following axioms are then defined. Axiom 7.

For technical reasons, it will sometimes be important to know that some of the results which we prove from ZFC do not in fact require all the axioms of ZFC; the reason for this is discussed at the end of  §4. We list here some abbreviations for commonly used subtheories of ZFC. ZF consists of Axioms O-8, ZF —  consists of Axioms O-7, and ZFC —  consists of Axioms O-7 plus Axiom 9. By ZFC”, ZF~, ZF~ — , and ZFC” — , we mean the respective theory (ZFC, ZF, ZF — ,and ZFC — ) with Axiom 2 (Foundation) deleted. Other abbreviations for weakenings of ZFC are usually self-explanatory. For example, ZF~ —  — Inf is ZF~ —  with the Axiom of Infinity deleted. === 第15页 === CHAPTER  THE FOUNDATIONS OF SET THEORY It is assumed that the reader has seen  development of mathematics based on some principles roughly resembling the axioms listed in §7 of the Introduction. In this chapter we review such  development, stressing some foundational points which will be important for later work. §1. Why axioms? Most mathematicians have little need for  precise codification of the set theory they use. It is generally understood which principles are correct beyond any doubt, and which are subject to question. For example, it is generally agreed that the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is not  basic prin- ciple, but rather an open conjecture, and we are all able, without the benefit of any formal axiomatization, to tell which of our theorems we have proved absolutely and which depend upon the (as yet undecided) truth or falsity of CH. However, in this book we are concemed with establishing results like: “CH is neither provable nor refutable from ordinary set-theoretic prin- ciples”, In order to make that statement precise, we must say exactly what those principles are; in this book, we have defined them to be the axioms of ZFC listed in the Introduction. The assertion: “CH is neither provable nor refutable from ZFC” is now  well-defined statement which we shall establish in Chapters VI and VII. The question remains as to whether the axioms of ZFC do embody all the “ordinary set-theoretic principles”. In this chapter we shall develop them far enough to be able to see how one can derive from them all of current conventional mathematics. Of course, future generations of mathematicians may come to realize some “obviously true” set-theoretic principles which do not follow from ZFC. Conceivably, CH could be then settled using those principles. Even at the present, there are several ways besides ZFC for handling the axiomatization of currently accepted set-theoretic principles (see §12). The 1 === 第16页 === 2 The foundations of set theory [Ch 1, §2 methods of this book are easily modified to handle those systems as well, although the technical details are slightly simpler for ZFC. §2. Why formal logic? The idea of setting down one’ axioms harks back to Euclid, and is hardly revolutionary. Usually in mathematics the axioms are stated in an informal language, such as Greek or English. But here we shall state our axioms in  formal, or artificial, language, called the first-order predicate calculus. The feature of  formal language is that there are precise rules of formation for linguistic objects. There are two main reasons for this approach. Reason 1. Formal logic is needed to state the axioms of set theory precisely. For example, ZFC has  Comprehension Axiom asserting that sets of the form {xe : ()} exist, where  is  given set and () is any property of . But what is  property? Intuitively, it is any well-defined English assertion about the variable . Is “ is happy”  property? It is clear that we need  rigorous definition of which properties we are to admit. We shall require that () be expressible in our formal language, which will be capable of expressing mathematical notions, but not non-mathematical ones. The fact that an imprecise notion of property can lead to trouble is illustrated by the follow- ing “paradox” in ordinary reasoning: Let  be the least positive integer not definable by an English expression using forty words or less. But  have just defined it in forty words or less. Reason 2. Even after we have defined ZFC, what does it mean to say that CH is not provable from ZFC? Intuitively, it means that there is no way of deriving CH from ZFC using legitimate rules of inference. This intuitive notion can be made precise using the concept of  formal deduction. We shall only sketch here the development of formal logic, referring the reader to  text on the subject, such as [Enderton 1972], [Kleene 1952], or [Shoenfield 1967], for  more detailed treatment. We shall give  precise definition of the formal language, as this is easy to do and is necessary for stating the axioms of ZFC. We shall only hint at the rules of formal deduc- tion; these are also not hard to define, but it then takes some work to see that the standard mathematical arguments can all be formalized within the prescribed rules. The basic symbols of our formal language are ~, 7, , (,), €&, =, and™ === 第17页 === Ch. 1, §2) Why formal logic? 3 ,; for each natural number . Intuitively, ~ means “and,” 7 means “not,”  means “there exists,” € denotes membership, = denotes equality, vp, O1, ... are variables, and the parentheses are used for phrasing. An expression is any finite sequence of basic symbols, such as )33-). The intuitive interpreta- tion of the symbols indicates which expressions are meaningful; these are called formulas. More precisely, we define  formula to be any expression constructed by the rules: (1) ,€O;, ; = ; are formulas for any , . (2) If @ and are formulas, so are () (), 3(@), and 4v,(@) for any . So, for example, 39 (3, ((vp € O4)  (, €9))) is  formula. Our formal definition departs somewhat from intuition in that, in an effort to make the definition simple, the use of parentheses was prescribed very restrictively. For example, Up EV,  (Vy  LQ) is not  formula. Another seeming drawback of our formal language is that it seems to lack the ability to express certain very basic logical notions, like, ..  (for all). However, this is not really  problem, since 7 (3v;,(—1(¢))) expresses Vv;(). Similar remarks hold for  (or), + (implies) and + (iff), which may all be expressed using ~ and 7. To save ourselves the work of always writing these longer expressions, we agree at the outset to use the following abbreviations. (1) Wv,(@) abbreviates 7 (3v;(—1(¢))). (2) ()  (WW) abbreviates = (((4)) 4 (2 ())). (3) () + () abbreviates ((4))  (). 4) (#) + () abbreviates ((4) > ()) » (() > ())- (5) Parentheses are dropped if it is clear from the context how to put them in. (6) ; # vj abbreviates 4 (; = ,) and ; ¢ ; abbreviates 4 (; € ;). (7) Other letters and subscripted letters from the English, Greek, and Hebrew alphabet are used for variables. We shall explain (7) in more detail later. There are many abbreviations other than these seven. Actually, in this book we shall very rarely see  formula. We shall follow standard mathe- matical usage of writing expressions mostly in English, augmented by logical symbols when this seems useful. For example, we might say “there are sets , ,  such that xey ~ yez”, rather than Bo (3O; (BO2 ((v9 € v1)  (v1 €v2))))- The Comprehension Axiom (see Reason (1) above) will be made into  precise statement by requiring that properties () occurring in it be ex- pressible in the formal language, but it will not be necessary to write out the formula expressing () each time the Comprehension Axiom is used. === 第18页 === 4 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, §2  subformula of @ is  consecutive sequence of symbols of @ which form  formula. For example, the 5 subformulae of (3x (vo € v1)  (32 (v2 €»1)) ) ATE Vp EV}, Wo (Vp EV;), V2 € Vy, Vy (V2 €,), and the formula (1) itself. The scope of an occurrence of  quantifier jv; is the (unique) subformula be- ginning with that 3v,. For example, the scope of the Ivp in (1) is v9 (vp EY). An occurrence of  variable in  formula is called bound iff it lies in the scope ofa quantifier acting on that variable, otherwise it is called free. For example, in (1) the first occurrence of , is free, but the second is bound, whereas vg is bound at its occurrences and 1, is free at its occurrence. Intuitively,  formula expresses  property of its free variables, whereas the bound or dummy variables are used just to make existential statements which could be made equally well with different bound variables. Thus, formula (1) means the same as (Avg (4 € O1)  (vg (v2 € P4))- Note that since Vv; is an abbreviation for 7 3v;7, it also binds its variable ;, whereas the abbreviations , >, « are defined in terms of other pro- positional connections and do not bind variables. Often in  discussion, we present  formula and call it $(,,...,,) to emphasize its dependence on ,,...,,. Then, later, if ,,..., , are other variables, (;, ...,¥,) Will denote the formula resulting from substituting  ; for each free occurrence of ;. Such  substitution is called free, or legitimate iff no free occurrence of an ; is in the scope of  quantifier ;. The idea is that $(,,...,,) says about ,,...,, What (,,...,,) said about ,,...,,, but this will not be the case if the substitution is not free and some ; gets bound by  quantifier of ¢. In general, we shall always as- sume that our substitutions are free. The use of the notation $(,,...,,) does not imply that each ; actually occurs free in #(,,...,,); also, (x1, .--),) may have other free variables which in the particular dis- cussion we are not emphasizing. For example, let @(,, O3) be formula (1). Then $(v2, vg) is (2v (v9 € v2)  (3r1 (v2 € v1), and (vo, vs) is (v9 (9 € v9))  (Avs (v2 € v1). (2) But this latter substitution is not free, and has perverted the meaning of ¢. The assertion in (,, v3) that “, has an element” became “some set is an element of itself” in (vo, vg).  sentence is  formula with no free variables; intuitively, it states an === 第19页 === Ch. 1, §2] Why formal logic? 5 assertion which is either true or false. ZFC is  certain set of sentences. If  is any set of sentences and ¢ is  sentence, then $+ ¢ means intuitively that @ is provable from  by  purely logical argument that may quote sentences in § as axioms but may not refer to the intended “meaning” of €. Formally, we define  + @ iff there is  formal deduction of ¢ from ; this is  finite sequence ,,...,, of formulas such that ¢, is ¢ and for each , either @; is in  or ¢; is  logical axiom or ¢; follows from @,,...,@;-1 by certain rules of inference. Notions such as “logical axiom” and “rule of inference” are defined purely syntactically. If St @ where  is the empty set of sentences, we write | @ and say that ¢ is logically valid. If (@ + ), we say ¢ and yw are logically equivalent. We do not dwell here on the precise definition of +, but merely remark on some of its properties. See §4 for further discussion. If @ is  formula,  universal closure of ¢ is  sentence obtained by uni- versally quantifying all free variables of @. For example, if ¢ is  =yVz(zEexerzey), then Vx Vy @ and Vy Vx ¢ are universal closures of ¢. All universal closures of  formula are logically equivalent. In common parlance, when one asserts @, One means to assert its universal closure. Formally, if  is  set of sen- tences and @ is  formula, we define  + ¢ to mean that the universal closure of ¢ is derivable from . The meaning of + @ when elements of  are not sentences is not the same in all presentations of logic and will not be dis- cussed here. We extend to formulas our notions of logical validity and logical equiva- lence. Thus, we call ¢ logically valid iff its universal closure is logically valid; and we say ¢ and  are logically equivalent iff ¢ +  is logically valid. Using the notion of logical equivalence, we may make precise the idea that bound variables are dummy variables. If @(,,...,,) is  formula with only ,,...,, free and $’(;, ...,,) results from replacing the bound variables of @ with other variables, then @ and ¢’ are logically equivalent. This enables us to be sloppy in our use of the various English, Greek, and Hebrew letters to stand for the official variables vo, ;, v2, .... For example, we have stated the Pairing Axiom as Vx Vy dz(xez  yez). Formally, we should have chosen some distinct , ,  and written the axiom as Wo, Wo, Avy (; € v_  Vj € Vy). However, all such choices of , ,  yield logically equivalent axioms. Likewise, when we use other abbreviations, we can be vague about which === 第2O页 === 6 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1 83 ofa number of logically equivalent unabbreviations is intended. For example,  Aw Ax could abbreviate either 6  (  ) or (  )  , but since these two formulas are logically equivalent, it usually does not matter which of the two sentences we choose officially to represent @    . If  is  set of sentences,  is consistent (Con()) iff for no @ does St and $+ 7@. If  is inconsistent, then +  for all  and  is thus of no interest. By formalizing reductio ad absurdum, one proves for any sentence  that St @ iff   {9} is inconsistent and $+ @ iff   {dp} is in- consistent. Thus, ZFC / CH is equivalent to Con(ZFC + CH), (ie, Con(ZFC vu {CH})). Intuitively,  =  means that  and  are the same object. This is re- flected formally in the fact that basic properties of equality are logically valid and need not be stated explicitly as axioms of ZFC. For example, kx =>Vz(zEexerzey), whereas the converse is not logically valid, although it is  theorem of ZFC since its universal closure is an axiom (Extensionality): Vx Vy (Wz(zexazey)>=). The fact that formal deductions from  are finite objects means that they can only mention  finite number of sentences in  even if  infinite. Thus, the following theorem holds. 2.1. THEOREM. () If + @, then there is  finite Sy <  such that Sgt ¢. () If  is inconsistent, there is  finite Sy <  such that So is inconsistent. O This will be important since ZFC is an infinite set of axioms. §3. The philosophy of mathematics This section presents  caricature of some extremes of mathematical thought. For  more serious discussion, see [Fraenkel-Bar-Hillel-Lévy 1973], [Kleene 1952], or [Kreisel—Krivine 1967].  Platonist believes that the set-theoretic universe has an existence out- side of ourselves, so that CH is in fact either true or false (although at present we do not know which). From this point of view, the axioms of ZFC are merely certain obviously true set-theoretic principles. The fact that these axioms neither prove nor refute CH says nothing about its truth or falsity and does not preclude the possibility of our eventually being able to decide CH using some other obviously true principles which we forgot to list in ZFC. But  Platonist should still be interested in this independence result, === 第21页 === Ch. 1.§3) The philosophy of mathematics 7 since it says that we are wasting our time trying to decide CH unless we can recognize some new valid principle outside of ZFC.  Finitist believes only in finite objects; one is not justified in forming the set of rational numbers, let alone the set of real numbers, so CH is  meaning- less statement. There is some merit in the Finitist’ position, since all ob- jects in known physical reality are finite, so that infinite sets may be discarded as figments of the mathematician’ imagination. Unfortunately, this point of view also discards much of modem mathematics. The Formalist can hedge his bets. The formal development of ZFC makes sense from  strictly finitistic point of view: the axioms of ZFC do not say anything, but are merely certain finite sequences of symbols. The assertion ZFC + @ means that there is  certain kind of finite sequence of finite sequences of symbols—namely,  formal proof of @. Even though ZFC contains infinitely many axioms, notions like ZFC+ @ will make sense, since one can recognize when  particular sentence is an axiom of ZFC.  Formalist can thus do his mathematics just like  Platonist, but if challenged about the validity of handling infinite objects, he can reply that all he is really doing is juggling finite sequences of symbols. Pedagogically, it is much easier to develop ZFC from  platonistic point of view, and we shall do so throughout this book. Thus, to establish that ZFC + @, we shall simply produce an argument that ¢ is true based on the assumption that the axioms of ZFC are true. Those readers who are For- malists and are skilled in formal logic will then see how to produce  formal proof of @ from ZFC. In some cases, when the formalistic interpretation of the material in  chapter is not immediately apparent, we have elaborated on this in an appendix to the chapter. It is important to make  distinction between the formal theory and the metatheory. If we are discussing ZFC, then the formal theory is ZFC, and  formal theorem is  sentence in the formal language provable from ZFC. If we announce, in our development of the formal theory: 3.1. THEorEM. There are uncountably many real numbers. O Then we mean that the sentence of the formal language which expresses Theorem 3.1 is  formal theorem of ZFC. The metatheory consists of what is really true. This distinction is some- what easier for the Finitist to make, since he must view the metatheory as being strictly finitistic. An example of  result in the metatheory is Con(ZFC) + Con(ZFC + CH). This is  statement about the formal theories which we shall establish in === 第22页 === 8 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1. 84 VI. The proof will provide an explicit constructive procedure which, when applied to an inconsistency in ZFC + CH would produce one in ZFC. The distinction between formal theory and metatheory is  little trickier for  Platonist. The Finitist can interpret Theorem 3.1 only as  formal theorem, since it talks about infinite objects and is therefore not really meaningful. To the Platonist, Theorem 3.1 also represents  true statement about the real world, but the fact that it is also  formal theorem means that it can be established on the basis of ZFC only. The Platonists of 21OO may know whether CH is true, but neither CH nor “CH will ever be  formal theorem of ZFC. Likewise, many Platonists of today believe that inaccessible cardinals exist, even though the statement that they exist is not  formal theorem of ZFC (see IV 6.9). Since what is “really true” for some Platonists may not be so for others, one cannot specify precisely what the platonistic metatheory is. Fortunately, in this book we need only assume that the metatheory contains all finitistic reasoning. §4. What we are describing We present here an informal discussion of the intended interpretation of the axioms of ZFC. The fact that there are other possible interpretations is the basis for all our independence proofs. An interpretation of the language of set theory is defined by specifying  non-empty domain of discourse, over which the variables are intended to vary, together with  binary relation on that domain, which is the interpre- tation of . If ¢ is any sentence in the language of set theory, ¢ is either true or false under  specified interpretation. As  frivolous example, we may let the domain of discourse be the set  of integers, and interpret xe yas  < . This is  legitimate interpretation for the language of set theory, even though the sentence vx 3y(yex) is true under this interpretation but refutable from ZFC. Of course, not all the axioms of ZFC are true under this interpretation. In the intended interpretation, under which the axioms of ZFC are pre- sumed true, € is interpreted to mean that  is  member of , but the domain of discourse is somewhat harder to describe. In accordance with the belief that set theory is the foundation of mathematics, we should be able to capture all of mathematics by just talking about sets, so our variables should not range over objects like cows and pigs. But if  is  cow, {} is  set, but not  legitimate mathematical object. More generally, since we wish to talk only about sets but also should be able to talk about any ele- ment ofa set in our domain of discourse, all the elements of such  set should === 第23页 === Ch. 1, 84) What we are describing 9 be sets also. Repeating this, we shall understand that our domain of dis- course consists of those  such that xisaset, and Vy(yex > yisaset), and vzVy(yex  zey—>zisaset), andete. We say such an  is hereditarily  set. Examples of such sets are O (the empty set), {O}, {O, {{O}}}. etc. The following is  more set-theoretic way of looking at the hereditary sets. Let (|)  be the union of all the sets in . Let ()° =  and ()"*! = (" ). Then  is an hereditary set iffx is  set and for each  = O, 1,2, . all elements of |)"  are sets. An important feature of our domain of discourse is that every element of an hereditary set is an hereditary set. This is needed to see the truth of the Axiom of Extensionality (see §5). The intended interpretation of set theory will be further discussed in III §4. We tum now to ad hoc interpretations; this is the basis of all consistency proofs in this book. If  is any set of sentences, we may show  is consistent by producing any interpretation under which all sentences of  are true. Usually, € will be still interpreted as membership, but the domain of dis- course will be some sub-domain of the hereditary sets. Thus, we shall produce one interpretation for ZFC + CH and another for ZFC + 4CH without ever deciding whether CH is true in the intended interpretation. The justification for this method of producing consistency proofs is the easy direction of the Gddel Completeness Theorem; that if  holds in some interpretation, then  is consistent. The reason this theorem holds is that the rules of formal deduction are set up so that if § + ¢, then @ must be true under any interpretation which makes all sentences in  true. If we fix an interpretation in which $ holds, then any sentence false in that interpreta- tion is not provable from . Since 1@ and @ cannot both hold in  given interpretation,  cannot prove both @ and 74; thus,  is consistent. The non-trivial direction of the Gddel Completeness Theorem is that if  is consistent, then  holds in some interpretation, whose domain of dis- course may be taken to be  countable set (but we may not be able to inter- pret € as real membership). We do not need this result in our work, but it is of interest, since it shows that the notion of consistency is not tied to  particular development of formal derivability. In fact, if we allow infinitistic methods in the metatheory, we may dispense entirely with formal proofs and define  to be consistent iff  holds in some interpretation, and define St @ iff  is true in every interpretation which makes all sentences of  true. It is then much easier to see when St ¢. In this approach, the Compact- ness Theorem (2.1) becomes  deep result rather than  trivial remark. === 第24页 === 1O The foundations of set theory (Ch. 1, 85 We now explain why it is of interest that some elementary set theory can be developed without the full strength of ZFC. When we define an inter- pretation for, say, ZFC + CH, it will not be trivial to verify immediately that all axioms of ZFC do indeed hold in our interpretation. We shall first check that  weak theory, such as ZF —  — Inf holds; this will imply that some simple set-theoretic facts are true, which will make it easier to under- stand what the axioms of Choice, Power Set, and Infinity mean under this interpretation. §5. Extensionality and Comprehension We begin to list and discuss the axiom of ZFC. Axiom O. Set Existence. ax( =).  This axiom says that our universe is non-void. Under most developments of formal logic, this is derivable from the logical axioms and thus redundant to state here, but we do so for emphasis. Axiom |. Extensionality. Vx Vy(Vz(zexozey)>=).  This says that  set is determined by its members. To recognize(informally) the truth of this axiom, it is important to note, by our discussion in §4, that the variables , ,  range only over the hereditary sets. Given hereditary sets  and , ¥( © + ) means that  and  have the same hereditary sets as members; but all members of  and  must be hereditary sets, so  and  have the same members and are hence the same set. The Comprehension Axiom is intended to formalize the construction of sets of the form {: ()} where () denotes some property of . Since the notion of property is made rigorous via formulas, it is tempting to set forth as axioms statements of the form dy Wx(xey@), where ¢ is  formula. Unfortunately, such  scheme is inconsistent by the famous Russell paradox: If @ is  ¢ , then this axiom gives us   such that Vx(xeyox¢?), whence  € + ¢ . Fortunately in mathematical applications it is sufficient to be able to use  property () to define  subset of  given set, so we postu- late Comprehension as follows. === 第25页 === Ch. 1, $5) Extensionality and Comprehension 1 Axiom 3. Comprehension Scheme. For each formula ¢ without  free, the universal closure of the following is an axiom: Fy Vx(xeyoxez ag)  @ may have any number of other variables free. The  asserted to exist is unique by Extensionality, and we denote this  by {xixez ao} or {xeEz: 9}. Variables other than  which are free in @ are considered parameters in this definition ofa subset of . Our restriction on  not being free in ¢ eliminates self-referential defini- tions of sets, for example, dy VWx(xeyoxez Ax¢gy) would be inconsistent with the existence of  non-empty . Note that the Comprehension Scheme, although it expresses one idea, yields an infinite collection of axioms—one for each ¢. If  is any set, we may form, by Comprehension, { €: + }, which is then  set with no members. By Axiom O, some set  exists, so there is  set with no members. By Extensionality, such  set is unique. We are thus justi- fied in making: 5.1. DEFINITION. O is the unique set  such that Vx(¢).  We can also prove that there is no universal set. 5.2. THEOREM. 32 Vx ( €). Proor. If Vx(xez), then, by Comprehension, form {xez:¢} = {:¢}, which would yield  contradiction by the Russell paradox dis- cussed above. O We let    abbreviate Vx(xe  + €). So, Ac AandOc . O is the only set which can be proved to exist from Axioms O, 1, and 3. To see this, consider the interpretation whose domain of discourse contains only the empty set, with € interpreted as the (vacuous) membership rela- tion. Axioms O, 1, and 3 hold in this interpretation, but so does Vy( = O), so Axioms O, 1, and 3 cannot refute Vy ( = O) (see 1V 2.8 for  more formal presentation of this argument). Of course, we need more axioms. === 第26页 === 12 The foundations of set theory [Ch 1. 36 §6. Relations, functions, and well-ordering The following intuitive picture should emerge from §5. For  given (), there need not necessarily exist  set {: @()}; this collection (or class) may be too big to form  set. In some cases, for example with {:  = }, the collection is provably too big. Comprehension says that if the collection is  sub-collection of  given set, then it does exist. In certain other cases, .. where the collection is finite or is not too much bigger in cardinality than  given set, it should exist but the axioms of §5 are not strong enough to prove that it does. We begin this section with  few more axioms saying that certain sets which should exist do, and then sketch the development of some basic set-theoric notions using these axioms. Axioms 4-8 of ZFC all say that certain collections do form sets. We actual- ly state these axioms in the (apparently) weaker form that the desired collection is  subcollection of  set, since we may then apply Comprehension to prove that the desired set exists. Stating Axioms 4-8 in this way will make it fairly easy to verify them in the various interpretations considered in Chapters VI and VII. Axiom 4. Pairing. YxVyac(xez ayes).  Axiom 5. Union. VF IAVY Wx(xeY  YEF + xe ). Oo Axiom 6. Replacement Scheme. For each formula ¢ without  free, the universal closure of the following is an axiom: vxe  aly (,) > 3Y VxeAayeYo(xy).  By Pairing, for  given  and  we may let  be any set such that xez  pez; then {véz: =   = } is the (unique by Extensionality) set whose elements are precisely  and ; we call this set {, }. {} = {, } is the set whose unique element is . (, > = {{}, {, }} is the ordered pair of  and . One must check that Vx Vy Vx’ Vy (Cxy> = (xX, Yo xXH=xX Apsy). In the Union Axiom, we are thinking of  as  family of sets and postulate the existence of  set  such that each member  of  is  subset of . This justifies our defining the union of the family , or () 7, by UF = {:3Ve (xeY)}; === 第27页 === Ch. $6) Relations, functions, and well-ordering 13 this set exists since it is also {xe :dVeF(xeY)}. When ¥ + O, we let (\ = {:VVeF (xeEY)}; this set exists since, for any Be , it is equal to {xe : VYeF (xe )} (so we do not appeal to the Union Axiom here). If = O, then (|)  =O and ia)  “should be” the set of all sets, which does not exist. Finally, we set An = ()\ {,}, AU = \) {,}, and ANB = {xe :¢ }. The Replacement Scheme, like Comprehension, yields an infinite collec- tion of axioms—one for each ¢. The justification of Replacement is: assuming Vx €  ly (,), we can try to let = {:3xeA (, )};  should be small enough to exist as  set, since its cardinality is < that of the set . Of course, by Replacement (and Comprehension), {:dxe  6(, )} does exist, since it is also {ye :3xeA (, )} for any  such that Vxe  aye  (, ). For any  and , we define the cartesian product Ax = {<,>:xEA  yeBh. To justify this definition, we must apply Replacement twice. First, for any €. we have Vxe  !( = (,), so by Replacement (and Comprehension) we may define prod(, ) = {:3xe ( = <, ))}. Now, Vye B4!lz( = prod(, )), so by Replacement we may define prod’(, ) = {prod(, ):  € }. Finally, we define    = () prod’(, ). We now review some other notions which may be developed on the basis of the Axioms O, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  relation is  set  all of whose elements are ordered pairs. dom() = {:Jy(<,> €)} === 第28页 === 14 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, $6 and ran() = {:4x(<, > € )}.

However, it is of some interest that much of the elementary development of set theory does not need AC, so in this chapter we shall explicitly indicate which re- sults have used AC in their proofs.

Many of the standard arithmetic operations on natural numbers can be defined on all the ordinals. We begin with successor. 7.1O. DEFINITION. () =  {}.  7.11. Lemma.

Formally, the notion of “finite” has not yet been defined; it will be defined, by using the concept of “natural num- ber,” in §1O. Many mathematical arguments involve operations with the set of natural numbers, but one cannot prove on the basis of the axioms so far presented that there is such  set (see IV 3.12). We thus need  new axiom: Axio 7. Infinity. 3x(Oex » Vyex((yex).  If  satisfies the Axiom of Infinity, then “by induction”,  contains all natural numbers. More rigorously, suppose  is  natural number and néx. #O, so  = () for some ; then  <,  is  natural number and ¢ ; son  #O. Let ’ be the least element of — ; but applying the above argument to ’ produces an ’ < ’ with ’ ¢ , which is  contra- diction. Now, by Comprehension, there is  set of natural numbers. The usual principle of induction (7.16 (4)) is stated in terms of this set, and in the future will replace awkward arguments in the style of the previous paragraph. 7.15.

Actually, the Axiom of Infinity is equivalent to postulating the existence of  limit ordinal, since any limit ordinal satisfies the axiom.

In those few cases when it makes  difference which definition of <, > is intended, we shall say so explicitly. In general, if  is  function with dom() = , we may think of  as an index set and  as  sequence indexed by . In this case, we often write 5; for (). Variants of Definition 7.22 are then used to explicitly define such functions; for example, {  {}: ie ) is the function  with dom() =  and () =  {} for allie /. When dom() is an ordinal «, we may think of  as  sequence of length . === 第36页 === 22 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, §8 If dom() = , we may concatenate the sequences  and  to form  sequence ~ of length  + . 7.23. DEFINITION. If sand ¢ are functions with dom() = aand dom() = , the function sr with domain «+ is defined by: (~)'= and (~)( + 6) = (2) for alle < 6.  §8. Remarks on defined notions In the previous few sections, we have introduced  large number of set- theoretic definitions, starting with O and  in §5. We now address the ques- tion of whether our handling of these is justified. From  Platonistic point of view, this question might seem to be  mere quibble, since it is standard mathematical practice to enlarge one’ vocabu- lary as one introduces new concepts. However, in our axiomatic treatment, we explicitly stated our Comprehension and Replacement Axioms to apply only with properties expressible in the original vocabulary as defined in §2. Yet, we have frequently quoted these axioms with properties defined using new vocabulary. It would thus appear that we need our language and axioms to be elastic, and to expand with time, although such an approach seems highly inelegant. To avoid this difficulty, we take the official position that our formal language never changes, and that any new symbols introduced merely represent new ways of abbreviating formulas. The reason for these new abbreviations is the same as that for using Vx to abbreviate 74x: to save space and promote clarity. It is important to note that the properties we express with these new symbols can, if need be, be expressed without them, so that our original Comprehension and Replacement Axioms apply. To elaborate on this further, there are two kinds of defined notions: defined relations and defined operations. When we introduce  defined relation between objects, we are merely defining  way of abbreviating  formula using  new symbol. For example,    abbreviates Vz( ex > ze ). The “new symbol” may be  fragment of English; “ is empty” abbreviates Vz ( ¢ ). The introduction of defined operations (..,  , {}, + ) or con- stants (.., O, «) is slightly more tricky, since this can be done only when our axiom system can prove that the definition makes sense. More formally, if @(,, ..., Xp, ) is  formula with no variables except ,, ...,,,  free, and  is  set of axioms such that SE WX, Wy TY OO1, Xa Wy then we may, when arguing from , “define” (,, ...,,) to be the  such === 第37页 === Ch. 1, §9) Classes and recursion 23 that (, ...,,, ). Then expressions in which  occurs are to be considered abbreviations for expressions in which  does not occur. The introduction of constants is the special case when  = O. For example, let $(, , ) be Vo(ve zo vex Avey). If  contains the instance of the Comprehension Axiom used to prove that Vx Vy 3! (, , 2), then we may use the symbol  4  when arguing from .  formula such as  © ye  OB can be expressed without the symbol /- in several ways— for example 32 3C (#(%, », 2) 4 (,,)  zeC), () or vz ¥((, , 2) O $(, ,) + 26O). 2) Since $+ Wx Vy 3! (, , ), formulas (1) and (2) are provably equivalent from . Note that the {:-++-+--+ } notation may be viewed similarly as  way of introducing defined operations. Thus, {: (, ;,..., ¥,)} is the unique  such that Wx ( 2 ( Vrs +5 In)» This notation is only used when  contains Extensionality and SEW, 2O5 Vy 32 VX (XE 2 (% V5 Os Yad) We consider partially defined operations (¢.., « + ), to be defined to be O outside their natural domains. So,  +  is defined for all ,  and is O unless  and  are both ordinals. We refer the reader to §13 for  more formal treatment of defined symbols. §9. Classes and recursion We have seen that there need not exist  set of the form {: ()}; the simplest example being {: = }. There is nothing wrong with thinking about such collections, and they sometimes provide useful motivation; but since they are outside the domain of discourse described by the axioms, they must never appear in  formal proof. See § 12 for remarks on set theories in which such collections do appear formally. Informally, we call any collection of the form {: @()}  class. We allow ¢ to have free variables other than , which are thought of as parameters upon which the class depends.  proper class is  class which does not form  set (because it is “too big”). The Comprehension Axiom says that any subclass of  set is  set. We use boldface letters to denote classes. Two use- ful classes, which are proper by Theorems 5.2 and 7.4, are given by the following. === 第38页 === 24 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1. §9 9.1. DEFINITION. ={: =} ON = {: isanordinal}.  Formally, proper classes do not exist, and expressions involving them must be thought of as abbreviations for expressions not involving them. Thus,  ¢ ON abbreviates the formula expressing that  is an ordinal, and ON =  abbreviates the (false) sentence (abbreviated by) Vx ( is an ordinal +  = ). There is, in fact, no formal distinction between  formula and  class; the distinction is only in the informal presentation. We could think of 9.1 as defining ON() to abbreviate the formula “ is an ordinal,” but it is useful to think of ON as  class if we wish to write expressions like ON 1  (to abbreviate { € :  is an ordinal}). Any of our defined predicates and functions might be thought of as  class. For example, we could think of the union operation as defining  class UN = {<<,),): = Uy}. Intuitively, UN:    > , and this motivates using an abbreviation like UN} (  6) for {xy 2:2 = Uy  xea  yeb} The abbreviations obtained with the class become very useful when dis- cussing general properties of classes. Asserting that  statement is true of all classes is equivalent to asserting  theorem schema. As an example of this, we state the principles of induction and recursion on ON. 9.2. THEOREM. Transfinite Induction on ON. If  < ON and  # O then  has  least element. Proor. Exactly like Theorem 7.3(5), which asserted the same thing when  isa set. Fix «€. If «is not the least element of , let  be the least ele- ment of « © . Then  is the least element of . O Mathematically, Theorems 7.3 (5) and 9.2 are very similar. But formally there is  great difference. Theorem 7.3 (5) is an abbreviation for one sen- tence which is provable, whereas 9.2 is  theorem schema, which represents an infinite collection of theorems. To state Theorem 9.2 without classes, we would have to say: for each formula (, ,,...,,), the following is  theorem: V2, ..-,2n { [Vx ( >  isan ordinal) , 3x ] > = [3x(  (CO,21,-.,2) 7 =]. === 第39页 === Ch. 1, §9) Classes and recursion 25 Note that here we are thinking of  as defining {: (, 2,,...,2,)}, with Z4,..-,, aS parameters. The fact that we may use parameters in the definition of classes implies that  schema such as 9.2 about all classes has, as one special case, the universal statement about all sets. Thus, if (, ) is  € , then (1) is equiva- lent to Vz {[ isa non-O set of ordinals] + [3x €zVyez( = )]}, which is Theorem 7.3 (5).  “proof by transfinite induction on ” establishes Va () by showing, for each , that (VB <  ()) > Ya. Then Va () follows, since Ja —(), the least « such that 7y() would lead to  contradiction.  similar result says that one can define  function of « recursively from information about the function below «. 9.3.

For uniqueness, if , and , both satisfied (2), one proves Va (,() = ,()) by transfinite induction on «. To establish existence, call   6-approximation iff  is  function with domain 6 and Va < 6 [() = (gf «)]. As in the uniqueness proof, if  is  6-approximation and ’ is  6’-approxi- mation, then gf (5 9 6’) = gf (6 16’). Next, by transfinite induction on 6, show that for each 6 there is  6-approximation (which is then unique). Now, define () to be the value (), where  is the 6-approximation for some(any) >  Theorem 9.3 may be stated more verbosely without using classes. Given  formula (, ) (with possibly other free variables), one can explicitly define  formula (, ) (the way  was defined above) so that Vx 3! (, ) + [Va 3! Ga, )  Va 3x dy((@, ) O (,) Ax =Gfa)] 3) is  theorem, where  = Gf  abbreviates  isa function \ domx =  O VBedomx (, ()). === 第4O页 === 26 The foundations of set theory {Ch. 1, 89 To express the uniqueness statement in Theorem 9.3, let ’(, ) be any other formula and let (3) be like (3) but with ’ instead of . Then the fol- lowing is also  theorem: [vx 3! (, ) 4 (3) ] + Va Vy (GE, ) >  (, )). Fortunately, it is rarely necessary in mathematical arguments about classes to translate away the classes; it is, however, important to know that this can be done in principle. One may think of the operations « +  and  - Bas being defined by trans- finite recursion on , with « as  fixed parameter, although it is easier to check their properties directly from the definitions given in §7. We dwell somewhat on the recursive definition of  +  to illustrate how the usual informal manner of presenting recursive definitions can, if desired, be re- duced to Theorem 9.3. Informally, we could have defined « + 8 by recursion on  via the clauses: +O=.  + () = ( + ). +  =sup{ + €:€ < } when Pisa limit ordinal. Since the function + as defined in 7.17. satisfies these clauses (by 7.18 (2), (4), (5), the two definitions are equivalent. More formally, we interject first  definition. 9.4, DEFINITION.  — | is  if  is  limit or O, and » if  = ().  Now, for each , define ,:  >  so that ,() is O unless  is  function with domain some ordinal , in which case ,() is « if  = O, (( — 1)) if  is  successor, and |) {(é):€ < } if  is  limit. Then Theorem 9.3 yieldsa unique , : ON >  such that VB [,() = ,(,{)]. The unique- ness implies, using Lemma 7.18 (2), (4), (5), that VaB [,() = « + 6]. More formally still, the subscripted « becomes an additional free variable in the formula  occurring in our official explication of Theorem 9.3. One can also define - by recursion using the clauses in Lemma 7.2O (2), (4), (5).  more useful application of recursion is in defining ordinal exponentia- tion, since  direct combinatorial definition of  is slightly complicated (see Exercise 7). 9.5.

An important special case, when 6 = @, is often used in arithmetic. For example, we define ! by the clauses: !=1. (+ Dl=nl-(n4+ 1). This may be cast more formally in the form of Theorem 9.3 as in the dis- cussion of « + 8 above. Here there are only two clauses, as there are no limit ordinals < @. §1O.

Appendix 1: Other set theories We discuss briefly two other systems of set theory which differ from ZF in that they give classes  formal existence. In both, all sets are classes,.but not all classes are sets. Let us temporarily use capital letters to range over classes. We define  to be  set iff 3Y( ¢), and we use lower case letters to range sets. In both systems, the sets satisfy the usual ZF axioms, and the intersection of  class with  set is  set. The system NBG (von Neumann-Bemays-Gédel, see [Gédel 194O]) has as  class comprehension axiom, the universal closure of aX Vy(ye Xo 6()), where @ may have other free set and class variables, but the bound variables of @ may only range over sets. NBG is  conservative extension of ZF; that is, if  is  sentence with only set variables, NBGt  iff ZF +  (see [Wang 1949], [Shoenfield 1954]). Unlike ZF, NBG is finitely axiomatizable. === 第5O页 === 36 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, §13 The system MK (Morse-Kelley; see the Appendix of [Kelley 1955]) strengthens NBG by allowing an arbitrary ¢ to appear in the class compre- hension axiom. MK is not  conservative extension of ZF and is not finitely axiomatizable (see Exercises 25, 26). None of the three theories, ZF, NBG, and MK, can claim to be the “right” one. ZF seems inelegant, since it forces us to treat classes, as we did in §9, via  circumlocution in the metatheory. Once we give classes  formal existence, it is hard to justify the restriction in NBG on the @ occurring in the class comprehension axiom, so MK seems like the right theory. How- ever, once we have decided to give classes their full rights, it is natural to consider various properties of classes, and to try to form super-classes, such as {RC ON  ON:  well-orders ON}. In MK, such objects can be handled only via an inelegant circumlocution in the metatheory. ZF, NBG, and MK are all founded on the same basic concepts, and the proofs in this book for ZF are easily adapted to the other two theories, although ZF is technically slightly easier to deal with.  set theory which is different in principle from ZF is Quine’ New Foundations, NF, see [Quine 1937], [Quine 1951], and [Rosser 1953]. Like ZF, NF has only sets, but  universal set exists: Jv Vx ( €). Unlike ZF, NF makes the restriction on forming {: 6()} not one of size, but of the syntactical form of @; @ must be stratified, which means roughly that it can be obtained from  formula of type theory by erasing the types.  =  is stratified, but  ex and ¢ are not, so one avoids Russell’ paradox. It is unknown whether NF is consistent, even assuming Con(ZF). It is known that NF + 4AC [Specker 1953]. NF is usually rejected as  foundation of mathematics for this reason and because we do not have  “clear” picture of the objects it describes as we get with ZF using Foundation (see III). The reader is referred ‘to [Fraenkel-Bar-Hillel-Lévy 1973] for  more detailed discussion of the various axiomatizations of set theory. §13. Appendix 2: Eliminating defined notions One aspect of our development of ZF which seems to be lacking in rigor is our treatment in §8 of defined notions. This is usually handled by the following general discussion in the metatheory. We specify  formal language by defining its set, , of non-logical symbols;  symbol of # may be an -place predicate symbol or an -place function symbol for some finite ; O-place function symbols are called constant symbols. = is considered  logical symbol, so for the language of set theory,  = {}.
