= £, or else £ = w, in which case s(£) = w, by the definition of order, so that again s(£) = £. The argument just presented is quite general; it proves that if a is an ordinal number, then so is a +. It follows that our counting process extends now up to and including u, and u+, and (w+)+, and so on ad infinitum. 76 Sec. 19 NAIVE SET THEORY At this point we make contact with our earlier discussion of what happens beyond w. The axiom of substitution implies easily that there exists a unique function F on u such that F(0) = a and F(n+) = (F(n))+ for each natural number n. The range of this function is a set of interest for us; a set of even greater importance is the union of the set u with the range of the function F. For reasons that will become clear only after we have at least glanced at the arithmetic of ordinal numbers, that union is usually denoted by w2. If, borrowing again from the notation of ordinal arith metic, we write u + n for F(n), then we can describe the set w2 as the set consisting of all n (with n in w) and of all w + n (with ninu). It is now easy to verify that oi2 is an ordinal number. The verification depends, of course, on the definition of order in o>2. At this point both that definition and the proof are left as exercises; our official attention turns to some general remarks that include the facts about u2 as easy special cases. An order (partial or total) in a set X is uniquely determined by its initial segments. If, in other words, R and S are orders in X, and if, for each x in X, the set of all i2-predecessors of a; is the same as the set of all 5-pred- ecessors of x, then R and S are the same. This assertion is obvious whether predecessors are taken in the strict sense or not. The assertion applies, in particular, to well ordered sets. From this special case we infer that if it is possible at all to well order a set so as to make it an ordinal number, then there is only one way to do so. The set alone tells us what the relation that makes it an ordinal number must be; if that relation sat isfies the requirements, then the set is an ordinal number, and otherwise it is not. To say that s(£) = £ means that the predecessors of £ must be just the elements of £. The relation in question is therefore simply the relation of belonging. If ij < £ is defined to mean i; « (- whenever £ and ij are elements of a set a, then the result either is or is not a well ordering of a such that s(£) = J for each £ in a, and a is an ordinal number in the one case and not in the other. We conclude this preliminary discussion of ordinal numbers by mention ing the names of the first few of them. After 0, 1, 2, • • • comes w, and after w, w + 1, w + 2, • • • comes w2. After w2 + 1 (that is, the successor of w2) comes u2 + 2, and then a2 + 3; next after all the terms of the sequence so begun comes w3. (Another application of the axiom of substitution is needed at this point.) Next come w3 + 1, w3 + 2, w3 + 3, • • •, and after them comes w4. In this way we get successively u, w2, w3, w4, • • ■. An ap plication of the axiom of substitution yields something that follows them all in the same sense in which w follows the natural numbers; that some- SEC. 19 ORDINAL NUMBERS 77 thing is wº.

The most elementary fact is that each element of an ordinal number a is at the same time a subset of a.
