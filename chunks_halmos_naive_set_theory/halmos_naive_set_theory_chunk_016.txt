f ordered pairs. Explicitly: a set 22 is a relation if each ele 26 Sec. 7 27 RELATIONS ment of R is an ordered pair; this means, of course, that if z « R, then there exist x and y so that z = (x, y). If 22 is a relation, it is sometimes con venient to express the fact that (a;, y) « R by writing xRy and saying, as in everyday language, that x stands in the relation R to y. The least exciting relation is the empty one. (To prove that 0 is & set of ordered pairs, look for an element of 0 that is not an ordered pair.) Another dull example is the Cartesian product of any two sets X and Y. Here is a slightly more interesting example: let X be any set, and let R be the set of all those pairs (x, y) in X X X for which x = y. The relation R is just the relation of equality between elements of X; if x and y are in X, then xRy means the same as x = y. One more example will suffice for now: let X be any set, and let R be the set of all those pairs (x, A) in X X <P(X) for which x e A. This relation R is just the relation of belonging between elements of X and subsets of X; if x e X and A « <P(X), then x R A means the same as x e A. In the preceding section we saw that associated with every set R of ordered pairs there are two sets called the projections of R onto the first and second coordinates. In the theory of relations these sets are known as the domain and the range of R (abbreviated dom 72 and ranfl); we recall that they are defined by dom R = {x: for some y (xRy)} and ran R = {y: for some x (xRy)}. If R is the relation of marriage, so that xRy means that a; is a man, y is a woman, and x and y are married to one another, then dom R is the set of married men and ran R is the set of married women. Both the domain and the range of 0 are equal to 0. If R = X X Y, then dom R — X and ran R = Y. If R is equality in X, then dom R = ran R = X. If R is belonging, between X and <P(X), then dom R = X and ran R = <P(X) - \0\- If R is a relation included in a Cartesian product XX Y (so that dom R c: X and ran R C Y), it is sometimes convenient to say that R is a relation from. X to Y; instead of a relation from X to X we may speak of a relation in X. A relation R in X is reflexive if x R x for every x in X; it is symmetric \i xRy implies that yRx; and it is transitive ii xRy and y R z imply that iflz. (Exercise: for each of these three possible properties, find a relation that does not have that property but does have the other two.) A relation 28 Sec. 7 NAIVE SET THEORY in a set is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The smallest equivalence relation in a set X is the relation of equality in X; the largest equivalence relation in X is X X X. There is an intimate connection between equivalence relations in a set X and certain collections (called partitions) of subsets of X. A partition of X is a disjoint collection 6 of non-empty subsets of X whose union is X. If R is an equivalence relation in X, and if x is in X, the equivalence class of x with respect to R is the set of all those elements y in X for which xRy. (The weight of tradition makes the use of the word "class" at this point unavoidable.) Examples : if R is equality in X, then each equivalence class is a singleton; if R = X X X, then the set X itself is the only equivalence class. There is no standard notation for the equivalence class of x with respect to R ; we shall usually denote it by x/R, and we shall write X/R for the set of all equivalence classes. (Pronounce X/R as "X modulo R," or, in abbreviated form, "X mod R." Exercise: show that X/R is indeed a set by exhibiting a condition that specifies exactly the subset X/R of the power set <P(X).) Now forget R for a moment and begin anew with a partition e of X. A relation, which we shall call X/e, is defined in X by writing * x/e y just in case x and y belong to the same set of the collection Q. We shall call X/ 6 the relation induced by the partition 6.
