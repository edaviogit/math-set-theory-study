to let A0 consist of 0 and the odd numbers, let Ai be the set obtained by doubling each non-zero element of Ao, and, inductively, let .An+1 be the set obtained by doubling each element of An, n ^ 1. Either way (and there are many others still) the details are easy to fill in. Conclusion: the union of a countably infinite family of countable sets is countable. Proof: given the family {Xn\ (n e w) of countable sets, find a family {/„} of func tions such that, for each n, the function /„ maps An onto Xn, and define a function / from w onto \Jn Xn by writing /(fc) = /„(fc) whenever k e An. This result combined with the result of the preceding paragraph implies that the union of a countable set of countable sets is always countable. An interesting and useful corollary is that the Cartesian product of two countable sets is also countable. Since XX Y= \Jv.Y(XX{y\), and since, if X is countable, then, for each fixed y in Y, the set X X {y} is obviously countable (use the one-to-one correspondence x —* (x, y)), the result follows from the preceding paragraph. Exercise. Prove that the set of all finite subsets of a countable set is countable. Prove that if every countable subset of a totally ordered set X is well ordered, then X itself is well ordered. On the basis of the preceding discussion it would not be unreasonable to guess that every set is countable. We proceed to show that that is not so; this negative result is what makes the theory of cardinal numbers interesting. Sec. 23 93 COUNTABLE SETS Cantor's theorem. Every set is strictly dominated by its power set, or, in other words, X < <?(X) for all X. Proof. There is a natural one-to-one mapping from X into <P(X), namely, the mapping that associates with each element x of X the single ton {x} . The existence of this mapping proves that X & <P(X) ; it remains to prove that X is not equivalent to <P(X). Assume that / is a one-to-one mapping from X onto (P(X) ; our purpose is to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Write A = {x e X: x e' f(x)\; in words, A consists of those elements of X that are not contained in the corresponding set. Since A e <P(X) and since / maps X onto <P(X), there exists an element a in X such that f(a) = A. The ele ment a either belongs to the set A or it does not. If a e A, then, by the definition of A, we must have a e' f(a), and since f(a) = A this is impos sible. If a e' A, then, again by the definition of A, we must have a ef(a), and this too is impossible. The contradiction has arrived and the proof of Cantor's theorem is complete. Since <P(X) is always equivalent to 2X (where 2X is the set of all functions from X into 2), Cantor's theorem implies that X < 2X for all X. If in particular we take w in the role of X, then we may conclude that the set of all sets of natural numbers is uncountable (i.e., not countable, non-de- numerable), or, equivalently, that 2" is uncountable. Here 2" is the set of all infinite sequences of O's and l's (i.e., functions from w into 2). Note that if we interpret 2" in the sense of ordinal exponentiation, then 2" is countable (in fact 2" = w). SECTION 24 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC One result of our study of the comparative sizes of sets will be to define a new concept, called cardinal number, and to associate with each set X a cardinal number, denoted by cardX. The definitions are such that for each cardinal number a there exist sets A with card A = a. We shall also define an ordering for cardinal numbers, denoted as usual by ^ . The connection between these new concepts and the ones already at our dis posal is easy to describe: it will turn out that card X = card Y if and only if X ~ Y, and card X < card Y if and only if X < Y. (If a and b are cardinal numbers, a <b means, of course, that a ^ b but a ^ b.) The definition of cardinal numbers can be approached in several different ways, each of which has its strong advocates.
