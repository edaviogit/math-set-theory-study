that w(0) = a and such that u(n+) = f(u(n)) for all n in w. Proof. Recall that a function from w to X is a certain kind of subset of u X X; we shall construct u explicitly as a set of ordered pairs. Con sider, for this purpose, the collection e of all those subsets A of w X X for which (0, a) e A and for which (n+,f(x)) e A whenever (n, x) e A. Since w X X has these properties, the collection 6 is not empty. We may, there fore, form the intersection u of all the sets of the collection 6. Since it is easy to see that u itself belongs to 6, it remains only to prove that u is a function. We are to prove, in other words, that for each natural number n there exists at most one element x of X such that (n, x) e u. (Explicitly: if both (n, x) and (n, y) belong to u, then x =■y.) The proof is inductive. Let S be the set of all those natural numbers n for which it is indeed true that (n, x) eu for at most one x. We shall prove that 0 eS and that if n eS, then n+ eS. Does 0 belong to S. If not, then (0, b) e u for some b distinct from a. Consider, in this case, the set w — { (0, b) } . Observe that this diminished set still contains (0, a) (since a ^ b), and that if the diminished set con tains (n, x), then it contains (n+,f(x)) also. The reason for the second assertion is that since n+ j& 0, the discarded element is not equal to Sec. 12 49 THE PEANO AXIOMS (n+,/(x)). In other words, u — {(0, 6)} e 6. This contradicts the fact that u is the smallest set in 6, and we may conclude that 0 e S. Suppose now that n eS; this means that there exists a unique element x in X such that (n, x) e u. Since (n, x) e u, it follows that (ra+, /(a;)) e w. If n+ does not belong to S, then (n+, i/)«u for some y different from f(x). Consider, in this case, the set u — {(n+, y) } . Observe that this diminished set contains (0, a) (since n+ 5^ 0), and that if the diminished set contains (to, t), say, then it contains (to+, /(<)) also. Indeed, if to = n, then t must be x, and the reason the diminished set contains (n+, /(x)) is that/(x) y; if, on the other hand, m ^ n, then the reason the diminished set contains (to+,/(0) is that m+ ^ n+. In other words, u — {(n+, y)\ e e. This again contradicts the fact that u is the smallest set in 6, and we may conclude that n+ « S. The proof of the recursion theorem is complete. An application of the recursion theorem is called definition by induction. Exercise. Prove that if n is a natural number, then n j± n+; if n ^ 0, then n = m+ for some natural number to. Prove that w is transitive. Prove that if E is a non-empty subset of some natural number, then there exists an element k in E such that k em whenever m is an element of E distinct from A;. SECTION 13 ARITHMETIC The introduction of addition for natural numbers is a typical example of definition by induction. Indeed, it follows from the recursion theorem that for each natural number to there exists a function sm from w to w such that sm(0) = m and such that sm(n+) = (sm(n))+ for every natural number n; the value sm(n) is, by definition, the sum m + n. The general arithmetic properties of addition are proved by repeated applications of the principle of mathematical induction. Thus, for instance, addition is associative. This means that (A; + to) + n = fc + (to + n) whenever fc, m, and n are natural numbers. The proof goes by induction on n as follows. Since (fc + TO)+0 = fc + to and fc + (to + 0) = fc + to, the equation is true if n = 0. If the equation is true for n, then (fc + to) + n+ = ((fc + to) + n)+ (by definition) = (fc + (to + n))+ (by the in duction hypothesis) — k + (to + n) + (again by the definition of addition) = fc + (to + n+) (ditto), and the argument is complete. The proof that addition is commutative (i.e., to + n = n + to f or all to and n) is a little tricky; a straightforward attack might fail.
