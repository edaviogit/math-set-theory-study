applying (P and U to E in the other order is a set that includes E as a subset, typically a proper subset. SECTION 6 ORDERED PAIRS What does it mean to arrange the elements of a set A in some order. Suppose, for instance, that the set A is the quadruple {a, b, c, d] of distinct elements, and suppose that we want to consider its elements in the order cb d a. Even without a precise definition of what this means, we can do something set-theoretically intelligent with it. We can, namely, consider, for each particular spot in the ordering, the set of all those elements that occur at or before that spot; we obtain in this way the sets {c} [c,b\ {c,b,d} {c, b, d, a}. We can go on then to consider the set (or collection, if that sounds better) 6= {{a, b, e,d), {b,c}, {b, c, d\, {c}} that has exactly those sets for its elements. In order to emphasize that the intuitively based and possibly unclear concept of order has succeeded in producing something solid and simple, namely a plain, unembellished set 6, the elements of 6, and their elements, are presented above in a scram bled manner. (The lexicographically inclined reader might be able to see a method in the manner of scrambling.) Let us continue to pretend for a while that we do know what order means. Suppose that in a hasty glance at the preceding paragraph all we could catch is the set 6; can we use it to recapture the order that gave rise to it. The answer is easily seen to be yes. Examine the elements of e (they themselves are sets, of course) to find one that is included in all the others; since {c} fills the bill (and nothing else does) we know that c must have been the first element. Look next for the next smallest element of 6, 22 Sec. 6 23 ORDERED PAIRS i.e., the one that is included in all the ones that remain after {c} is removed; since {b, c} fills the bill (and nothing else does), we know that b must have been the second element. Proceeding thus (only two more steps are needed) we pass from the set 6 to the given ordering of the given set A. The moral is this: we may not know precisely what it means to order the elements of a set A, but with each order we can associate a set 6 of subsets of A in such a way that the given order can be uniquely recaptured from 6. (Here is a non-trivial exercise: find an intrinsic characterization of those sets of subsets of A that correspond to some order in A. Since "order" has no official meaning for us yet, the whole problem is officially meaning less. Nothing that follows depends on the solution, but the reader would learn something valuable by trying to find it.) The passage from an order in A to the set 6, and back, was illustrated above for a quadruple; for a pair everything becomes at least twice as simple. If A = {a, b\ and if, in the desired order, a comes first, then Q = {{a}, [a, b}}; if, however, b comes first, then e = { {&}, {a, b}}. The ordered pair of a and b, with first coordinate a and second coordinate b, is the set (a, b) defined by ^/ lA However convincing the motivation of this definition may be, we must still prove that the result has the main property that an ordered pair must have to deserve its name. We must show that if (a, b) and (x, y) are or dered pairs and if (a, b) = (x, y), then a = x and b = y. To prove this, we note first that if a and b happen to be equal, then the ordered pair (a, b) is the same as the singleton {{a}}. If, conversely, (a, b) is a singleton, then {a} = {a, b\, so that be {a}, and therefore a = b. Suppose now that (a, b) = (x, y). If a = b, then both (a, b) and (x, y) are singletons, so that x = y; since {x} e (a, b) and {a} e (x, y), it follows that a, b, x, and y are all equal. If a ^ b, then both (a, b) and (x, y) contain exactly one single ton, namely {a} and {x} respectively, so that a = x.
