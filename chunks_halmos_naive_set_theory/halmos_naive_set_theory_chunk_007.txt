e following principle is a good beginning. Axiom of pairing. For any two sets there exists a set that they both be long to. Note that this is just the affirmative answer to the second question above. To reassure worriers, let us hasten to observe that words such as "two," "three," and "four," used above, do not refer to the mathematical concepts bearing those names, which will be defined later; at present such words are merely the ordinary linguistic abbreviations for "something and then some thing else" repeated an appropriate number of times. Thus, for instance, the axiom of pairing, in unabbreviated form, says that if a and b are sets, then there exists a set A such that a e A and b e A. One consequence (in fact an equivalent formulation) of the axiom of pairing is that for any two sets there exists a set that contains both of them and nothing else. Indeed, if a and b are sets, and if A is a set such that a e A and b e A, then we can apply the axiom of specification to A with the sentence "x = a or x = b." The result is the set \x e A: x = a or x = b\, and that set, clearly, contains just a and b. The axiom of extension im plies that there can be only one set with this property. The usual symbol for that set is {a, b}; the set is called the pair (or, by way of emphatic comparison with a sub sequent concept, the unordered pair) formed by a and b. If, temporarily, we refer to the sentence "x = a or x = 6" as S(x), we may express the axiom of pairing by saying that there exists a set B such that (*) x eB if and only if S(x). The axiom of specification, applied to a set A, asserts the existence of a set B such that (**) xeB if and only if (x « A and S(x)). 10 NAIVE SET THEORY SEC. 3 The relation between (*) and (**) typifies something that occurs quite frequently. All the remaining principles of set construction are pseudo special cases of the axiom of specification in the sense in which (*) is a pseudo-special case of (**). They all assert the existence of a set specified by a certain condition; if it were known in advance that there exists a set containing all the specified elements, then the existence of a set containing just them would indeed follow as a special case of the axiom of specification. If a is a set, we may form the unordered pair {a, ał. That unordered pair is denoted by {a} and is called the singleton of a; it is uniquely characterized by the state ment that it has a as its only element. Thus, for instance, Ø and {25% are very different sets; the former has no elements, whereas the latter has the unique element 25. To say that a e A is equivalent to saying that {a} C A. The axiom of pairing ensures that every set is an element of some set and that any two sets are simultaneously elements of some one and the same set. (The corresponding questions for three and four and more sets will be answered later.) Another pertinent comment is that from the as sumptions we have made so far we can infer the existence of very many sets indeed. For examples consider the sets 25, {2j}, {{2}}, {{{2}}}, etc.; consider the pairs, such as {2, $25;}, formed by any two of them; consider the pairs formed by any two such pairs, or else the mixed pairs formed by any singleton and any pair; and proceed so on ad infinitum. ExERCISE. Are all the sets obtained in this way distinct from one another. Before continuing our study of set theory, we pause for a moment to discuss a notational matter. It seems natural to denote the set B described in (*) by {z: S(x)}; in the special case that was there considered {z: a = a or z = b = {a, b}. We shall use this symbolism whenever it is convenient and permissible to do so. If, that is, S(x) is a condition on a such that the z's that S(x) speci fies constitute a set, then we may denote that set by {z: S(x)}. In case A is a set and S(x) is (a e A), then it is permissible to form {2: S(x)}; in fact {z: z e A] = A. SEC.
