inal number equivalent to X. Exercise. Prove that each infinite cardinal number is a limit number. Since each set is equivalent to its cardinal number, it follows that if card X = card Y, then X ~ Y. If, conversely, X ~ Y, then card X ~ card Y. Since card X is the least ordinal number equivalent to X, it fol lows that card X ^ card Y, and, since the situation is symmetric in X and Y, we also have card Y ^ card X. In other words card X = card Y if and only if X ~ Y; this was one of the conditions on cardinal numbers that we needed in the development of cardinal arithmetic. A finite ordinal number (i.e., a natural number) is not equivalent to any finite ordinal number distinct from itself. It follows that if X is finite, then the set of ordinal numbers equivalent to X is a singleton, and, con sequently, the cardinal number of X is the same as the ordinal number of X. Both cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers are generalizations of the natural numbers; in the familiar finite cases both the generalizations coin cide with the special case that gave rise to them in the first place. As an almost trivial application of these remarks, we can now calculate the car dinal number of a power set <P(A): if card A = a, then card <P(A) = 2". (Note that the result, though simple, could not have been stated before this; till now we did not know that 2 is a cardinal number.) The proof is immediate from the fact that <P(A) is equivalent to 2A. If a and 0 are ordinal numbers, we know what it means to say that a < /3 or a 2= /3. It follows that cardinal numbers come to us automati cally equipped with an order. The order satisfies the conditions we bor rowed for our discussion of cardinal arithmetic. Indeed: if cardX < card Y, then card X is a subset of card Y, and it follows that X ^ Y. If we had X ~ Y, then, as we have already seen, we should have card X = card Y; it follows that we must have X < Y. If, finally, X < Y, then it is impossible that card Y ^ card X (for similarity implies equivalence), and hence card X < card Y. As an application of these considerations we mention the inequality o <2°, Sec. 25 101 CARDINAL NUMBERS valid for all cardinal numbers a. Proof: if A is a set with card A — a, then A < <P(A), hence card A < card <P{A), and therefore a < 2°. Exercise. If card A = a, what is the cardinal number of the set of all one-to-one mappings of A onto itself. What is the cardinal number of the set of all countably infinite subsets of A. The facts about the ordering of ordinal numbers are at the same time facts about the ordering of cardinal numbers. Thus, for instance, we know that any two cardinal numbers are comparable (always either a < b, or a = b, or b < a), and that, in fact, every set of cardinal numbers is well ordered. We know also that every set of cardinal numbers has an upper bound (in fact, a supremum), and that, moreover, for every set of cardinal numbers, there is a cardinal number strictly greater than any of them. This implies of course that there is no largest cardinal number, or, equiv- alently, that there is no set that consists exactly of all the cardinal num bers. The contradiction, based on the assumption that there is such a set, is known as Cantor's paradox. The fact that cardinal numbers are special ordinal numbers simplifies some aspects of the theory, but, at the same time, it introduces the possi bility of some confusion that it is essential to avoid. One major source of difficulty is the notation for the arithmetic operations. If a and b are cardinal numbers, then they are also ordinal numbers, and, consequent'y, the sum a + b has two possible meanings. The cardinal sum of two car dinal numbers is in general not the same as their ordinal sum. All this sounds worse than it is; in practice it is easy to avoid confusion. The context, the use of special symbols for cardinal numbers, and an occasional explicit warning can make the discussion flow quite smoothly. Exercise.
