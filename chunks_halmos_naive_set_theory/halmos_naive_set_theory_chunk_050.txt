y + f)y. Example: (1 + l)w = 2w = w, but lw + lw = w + w = w2. Just as repeated addition led to the definition of ordinal products, re peated multiplication could be used to define ordinal exponents. Alter natively, exponentiation can be approached via transfinite recursion. The precise details are part of an extensive and highly specialized theory of ordinal numbers. At this point we shall be content with hinting at the definition and mentioning its easiest consequences. To define a. (where a and 0 are ordinal numbers), use definition by transfinite induction (on /3). Begin by writing a0 = 1 and a8"*"1 = ofia; if 0 is a limit number, define cP as the supremum of the numbers of the form a"1, where y < /3. If this sketch of a definition is formulated with care, it follows that 0° = 0 (a £ 1), V = 1, a*+* = a"aT, a". = (efi)\ Sec. 21 85 ORDINAL ARITHMETIC Not all the familiar laws of exponents hold; thus, for instance, (a/3)T is in general different from a1p. Example: (2 •2)" = 4" = w, but 2" -2" = 2 WO) = 0) . Warning: the exponent notation for ordinal numbers, here and below, is not consistent with our earlier use of it. The unordered set 2" of all func tions from w to 2, and the well ordered set 2" that is the least upper bound of the sequence of ordinal numbers 2, 2-2, 2-2-2, etc., are not the same thing at all. There is no help for it; mathematical usage is firmly estab lished in both camps. If, in a particular situation, the context does not reveal which of the two interpretations is to be used, then explicit verbal indication must be given. SECTION 22 THE SCHRODER-BERNSTEIN THEOREM The purpose of counting is to compare the size of one set with that of another; the most familiar method of counting the elements of a set is to arrange them in some appropriate order. The theory of ordinal numbers is an ingenious abstraction of the method, but it falls somewhat short of achieving the purpose. This is not to say that ordinal numbers are use less; it just turns out that their main use is elsewhere, in topology, for in stance, as a source of illuminating examples and counterexamples. In what follows we shall continue to pay some attention to ordinal numbers, but they will cease to occupy the center of the stage. (It is of some impor tance to know that we could in fact dispense with them altogether. The theory of cardinal numbers can be constructed with the aid of ordinal numbers, or without it; both kinds of constructions have advantages.) With these prefatory remarks out of the way, we turn to the problem of comparing the sizes of sets. The problem is to compare the sizes of sets when their elements do not appear to have anything to do with each other. It is easy enough to de cide that there are more people in France than in Paris. It is not quite so easy, however, to compare the age of the universe in seconds with the population of Paris in electrons. For some mathematical examples, con sider the following pairs of sets, defined in terms of an auxiliary set A: (i) X = A, Y = A+; (ii) X = <P(A), Y = 2A; (iii) X is the set of all one-to- one mappings of A into itself, Y is the set of all finite subsets of A. In each case we may ask which of the two sets X and Y has more elements. The problem is first to find a rigorous interpretation of the question and then to answer it. The well ordering theorem tells us that every set can be well ordered. For well ordered sets we have what seems to be a reasonable measure of 86 Sec. 22 THE SCHRODER-BERNSTEIN THEOREM 87 size, namely, their ordinal number. Do these two remarks solve the prob lem. To compare the sizes of X and Y, may we just well order each of them and then compare ord X and ord Yl The answer is most emphati cally no. The trouble is that one and the same set can be well ordered in many ways. The ordinal number of a well ordered set measures the well ordering more than it measures the set. For a concrete example consider the set w of all natural numbers.
