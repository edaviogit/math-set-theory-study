um ber, it follows also that every subset of a finite set is finite. The number of elements in a finite set E is, by definition, the unique natural number equivalent to E; we shall denote it by §{E). It is clear that if the correspondence between E and §{E) is restricted to the finite subsets of some set X, the result is a function from a subset of the power set <P(X) to w. This function is pleasantly related to the familiar set- theoretic relations and operations. Thus, for example, if E and F are finite sets such that E C F, then §{E) ^ jf(F). (The reason is that since E <~ §{E) and F ~ #(F), it follows that §(E) is equivalent to a subset of #(F).) Another example is the assertion that if E and F are finite sets, then E U F is finite, and, moreover, if E and F are disjoint, then §(E U F) = §(E) + §{F ). The crucial step in the proof is the fact that if m and n are natural numbers, then the complement of m in the sum to + n is equiv alent to n; the proof of this auxiliary fact is achieved by induction on n. Similar techniques prove that if E and F are finite sets, then so also are EXF and EF, and, moreover, §(E X F) = ${E)-${F) and §{EF) = #(£)«'). Exercise. The union of a finite set of finite sets is finite. If E is finite, then <P(E) is finite and, moreover, §(<P(E)) = 2HE). If E is a non-empty finite set of natural numbers, then there exists an element k in E such that m ^ kf or all m in E. SECTION 14 ORDER Throughout mathematics, and, in particular, for the generalization to infinite sets of the counting process appropriate to finite sets, the theory of order plays an important role. The basic definitions are simple. The only thing to remember is that the primary motivation comes from the familiar properties of "less than or equal to" and not "less than." There is no profound reason for this; it just happens that the generalization of "less than or equal to" occurs more frequently and is more amenable to algebraic treatment. A relation R in a set X is called antisymmetric if, for every x and y in X, the simultaneous validity olxRy and y Rx implies that x = y. A partial order (or sometimes simply an order) in a set X is a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation in X. It is customary to use only one symbol (or some typographically close relative of it) for most partial orders in most sets; the symbol in common use is the familiar inequality sign. Thus a partial order in X may be defined as a relation ^ in X such that, for all x, y, and z in X, we have (i) x ^ x, (ii) if x ^ y and y ^ x, then x = y, and (iii) if x ^ y and y f£ z, then x ^ z. The reason for the qualifying "par tial" is that some questions about order may be left unanswered. If for every x and y in X either x ^ y or y ^ x, then f£ is called a total (some times also simple or linear) order. A totally ordered set is frequently called a chain. Exercise. Express the conditions of antisymmetry and totality for a relation R by means of equations involving R and its inverse. The most natural example of a partial (and not total) order is inclusion. Explicitly: for each set X, the relation <z is a partial order in the power set <P(X) ; it is a total order if and only if X is empty or X is a singleton. A 54 Sec. 14 55 ORDER well known example of a total order is the relation "less than or equal to" in the set of natural numbers. An interesting and frequently seen partial order is the relation of extension for functions. Explicitly: for given sets X and Y, let F be the set of all those functions whose domain is included in X and whose range is included in Y. Define a relation R in F by writing fRgia case dom/ C dom g and f(x) = g(x) for all x in dom /; in other words, fRg means that / is a restriction of g, or, equivalently, that g is an extension of /. If we recall that the functions in F are, after all, certain subsets of the Cartesian product X X Y, we recognize that fRg means the same as / C jr; extension is a special case of inclusion.
