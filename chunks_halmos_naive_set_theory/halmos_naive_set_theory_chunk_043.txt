b, where b is that least one, then a ^ /(a); it follows, in particular, with a = /(6), that f(b) ^ f(f(b)). Since, however, f(b) < b, the order-preserving character of / implies that /(/(&)) < f(b). The only way out of the contradiction is to admit the impossibility of /(£>) < b. The result of the preceding paragraph has three especially useful conse quences. The first of these is the fact that if two well ordered sets, X and Y say, are similar at all, then there is just one similarity between them. Suppose indeed that both g and h are similarities from X onto Y, and write f = g~ 1h. Since / is a similarity of X onto itself, it follows that a ^ /(a) for each a in X. This means that a ^ g>_1(/i(a)) for each a in X. Apply ing g, we infer that g(a) ^ h{a) for each a in X. The situation is symmetric in g and h, so that we may also infer that h(a) ^ g(a) for each a in X. Conclusion: g = h. Sec. 18 73 TRANSFINITE RECURSION A second consequence is the fact that a well ordered set is never similar to one of its initial segments. If, indeed, X is a well ordered set, a is an element of X, and / is a similarity from X onto s(a), then, in particular, /(a) e s(a), so that /(a) < a, and that is impossible. The third and chief consequence is the comparability theorem for well ordered sets. The assertion is that if X and F are well ordered sets, then either X and F are similar, or one of them is similar to an initial segment of the other. Just for practice we shall use the transfinite recursion theorem in the proof, although it is perfectly easy to avoid it. We assume that X and Y are non-empty well ordered sets such that neither is similar to an initial segment of the other; we proceed to prove that under these circum stances X must be similar to Y. Suppose that a « X and that t is a sequence of type a in F; in other words t is a function from s(a) into Y. Let/(<) be the least of the proper upper bounds of the range of t in Y, if there are any; in the contrary case, let/(£) be the least element of Y. In the terminology of the transfinite recursion theorem, the function / thereby determined is a sequence function of type X in Y. Let U be the function that the trans finite recursion theorem associates with this situation. An easy argument (by transfinite induction) shows that, for each z in X, the function U maps the initial segment determined by a in X one-to-one onto the initial seg ment determined by U(a) in Y. This implies that U is a similarity, and the proof is complete. Here is a sketch of an alternative proof that does not use the transfinite recursion theorem. Let X0 be the set of those elements a of X for which there exists an element b of Y such that s(a) is similar to s(b). For each a in X0, write U(a) for the corresponding (uniquely determined) b in F, and let F0 be the range of U. It follows that either X0 = X, or else X0 is an initial segment of X and F0 = F. Exercise;. Each subset of a well ordered set X is similar either to X or to an initial segment of X. If X and F are well ordered sets and X ^ F (i.e., X is similar to F), then the similarity maps the least upper bound (if any) of each subset of X onto the least upper bound of the image of that subset. SECTION 19 ORDINAL NUMBERS The successor x + of a set x was denned as x U {x}, and then w was con structed as the smallest set that contains 0 and that contains x+ whenever it contains x. What happens if we start with w, form its successor w+, then form the successor of that, and proceed so on ad infinitum. In other words: is there something out beyond w, w+, (w+)+, ■• •, etc., in the same sense in which w is beyond 0, 1, 2, • • •, etc.. The question calls for a set, say T, containing w, such that each element of T (other than w itself) can be obtained from w by the repeated formation of successors. To formulate this requirement more precisely we introduce some special and temporary terminology.
