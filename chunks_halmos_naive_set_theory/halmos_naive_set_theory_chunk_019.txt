nction/ is called the projection from X X Y onto X; if, similarly, g(x, y) = y, then g is the projection from X X Y onto Y. The terminology here is at variance with an earlier one, but not too badly. If R = X X Y, then what was earlier called the projection of R onto the first coordinate is, in the present lan guage, the range of the projection /. A more complicated and correspondingly more valuable example of a function can be obtained as follows. Suppose R is an equivalence relation in X, and let / be the function from X onto X/R defined by /(x) = x/R. The function / is sometimes called the canonical map from X to X/R. If / is an arbitrary function, from X onto Y, then there is a natural way of defining an equivalence relation 72 in X; write a R b (where a and b are in X) in case /(a) = f(b). For each element y of Y, let g(y) be the set of all those elements x in X for which f(x) = y. The definition of R implies that g(y) is, for each y, an equivalence class of the relation R; in other words, g is a function from Y onto the set X/R of all equivalence classes of R. The function g has the following special property: if u and v are distinct elements of Y, then g{u) and g(v) are distinct elements of X/R. A function that always maps distinct elements onto distinct elements is called one-to-one (usually a one-to-one correspondence). Among the exam ples above the inclusion maps are one-to-one, but, except in some trivial special cases, the projections are not. (Exercise: what special cases?) To introduce the next aspect of the elementary theory of functions we must digress for a moment and anticipate a tiny fragment of our ultimate definition of natural numbers. We shall not find it necessary to define all the natural numbers now; all we need is the first three of them. Since this is not the appropriate occasion for lengthy heuristic preliminaries, we shall proceed directly to the definition, even at the risk of temporarily shocking or worrying some readers. Here it is: we define 0, 1, and 2 by writing 0 = 0, 1 = {0}, and 2 = [0, \0\\. In other words, 0 is empty, 1 is the singleton {0}, and 2 is the pair {0, 1}. Sec. 8 33 FUNCTIONS Observe that there is some method in this apparent madness; the number of elements in the sets 0, 1, or 2 (in the ordinary everyday sense of the word) is, respectively, zero, one, or two. If A is a subset of a set X, the characteristic function of A is the function X from X to 2 such that x(x) = 1 or 0 according as x e A or x e X — A. The dependence of the characteristic function of A on the set A may be indicated by writing xa instead of x- The function that assigns to each subset A of X (that is, to each element of <P(X)) the characteristic function of A (that is, an element of 2X) is a one-to-one correspondence between <P(X) and 2X. (Parenthetically: instead of the phrase "the function that assigns to each A in <P(X) the element xa in 2X" it is customary to use the abbreviation "the function A — » xa-" In this language, the projection from X X Y onto X, for instance, may be called the function (x, y) — » x, and the canonical map from a set X with a relation R onto X/R may be called the function x — » x/R.) Exercise. (i) Y& has exactly one element, namely 0, whether Y is empty or not, and (ii) if X is not empty, then 0X is empty. SECTION 9 FAMILIES There are occasions when the range of a function is deemed to be more important than the function itself. When that is the case, both the ter minology and the notation undergo radical alterations. Suppose, for in stance, that a; is a function from a set / to a set X. (The very choice of letters indicates that something strange is afoot.) An element of the do main 7 is called an index, I is called the index set, the range of the function is called an indexed set, the function itself is called a family, and the value of the function x at an index i, called a term of the family, is denoted by x,-.
