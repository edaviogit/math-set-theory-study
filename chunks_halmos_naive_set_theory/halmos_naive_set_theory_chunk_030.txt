re distinct natural numbers, then a necessary and sufficient condi 52 Sec. 13 NAIVE SET THEORY tion that m en is that to C n. Indeed, the implication from toen to m C n is just the transitivity of n. If, conversely, m C n and to n, then n em cannot happen (for then m would be a subset of one of its ele ments), and therefore men. If m en, or if, equivalently, m is a proper subset of n, we shall write m < n and we shall say that m is less than n. If m is known to be either less than n or else equal to n, we write m ^ n. Note that and < are relations in w. The former is reflexive, but the latter is not; neither is symmetric; both are transitive. If to ^ n and n ^ m, then m = n. Exercise. Prove that if to < n, then to + fc < n + fc, and prove that if m < n and k ^ 0, then to-fc < n-fc. Prove that if E is a non-empty set of natural numbers, then there exists an element k in E such that k ^ m for all m in 2?. Two sets E and F (not necessarily subsets of w) are called equivalent, in symbols E ~ F, if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them. It is easy to verify that equivalence in this sense, for subsets of some par ticular set X, is an equivalence relation in the power set (P(X). Every proper subset of a natural number n is equivalent to some smaller natural number (i.e., to some element of n). The proof of this assertion is inductive. For n = 0 it is trivial. If it is true for n, and if E is a proper subset of n+, then either E is a proper subset of n and the induction hy pothesis applies, or E = n and the result is trivial, orneE. In the latter case, find a number k in n but not in E and define a function / on E by writing f(i) = i when t n and f(n) = k. Clearly / is one-to-one and / maps E into n. It follows that the image of E under / is either equal to n or (by the induction hypothesis) equivalent to some element of n, and, conse quently, E itself is always equivalent to some element of n+. It is a mildly shocking fact that a set can be equivalent to a proper sub set of itself. If, for instance, a function / from w to oi is defined by writing /(n) = n+ for all n in to, then / is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all natural numbers and the proper subset consisting of the non-zero natural numbers. It is nice to know that even though the set of all natural numbers has this peculiar property, sanity prevails for each particular nat ural number. In other words, if n e w, then n is not equivalent to a proper subset of n. For n = 0 this is clear. Suppose now that it is true for n, and suppose that / is a one-to-one correspondence from n+ to a proper subset E of n+. If n «' E, then the restriction of / to n is a one-to-one correspond ence between n and a proper subset of n, which contradicts the induction hypothesis. If n e E, then n is equivalent to E — [n}, so that, by the in Sec. 13 53 ARITHMETIC duction hypothesis, n = E — [n\. This implies that E = n+, which con tradicts the assumption that E is a proper subset of n+. A set E is called finite if it is equivalent to some natural number; other wise E is infinite. Exercise. Use this definition to prove that w is infinite. A set can be equivalent to at most one natural number. (Proof: we know that for any two distinct natural numbers one must be an element and therefore a proper subset of the other; it follows from the preceding paragraph that they cannot be equivalent.) We may infer that a finite set is never equivalent to a proper subset; in other words, as long as we stick to finite sets, the whole is always greater than any of its parts. Exercise. Use this consequence of the definition of finiteness to prove that u is infinite. Since every subset of a natural number is equivalent to a natural num ber, it follows also that every subset of a finite set is finite. The number of elements in a finite set E is, by definition, the unique natural number equivalent to E; we shall denote it by §{E).
