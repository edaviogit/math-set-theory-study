eat the empty collection; according to the new define tion C\x*0 X is equal to E. (For which elements x of E can it be false that x e X for every X in 0?) The difference is just a matter of language. A little reflection reveals that the "new" definition offered for the inter section of a collection 6 of subsets of E is really the same as the old defini tion of the intersection of the collection (3 U \E], and the latter is never empty. We have been considering the subsets of a set E; do those subsets them selves constitute a set. The following principle guarantees that the answer is yes. Axiom of powers. For each set there exists a collection of sets thai con tains among its elements all the subsets of the given set. In other words, if E is a set, then there exists a set (collection) CP such that if X <= E, then X e CP. The set CP described above may be larger than wanted; it may contain elements other than the subsets of E. This is easy to remedy; just apply the axiom of specification to form the set {X e <P: X C E}. (Recall that "X <z E" says the same thing as "for all x (if x eX then x e E).") Since, for every X, a necessary and sufficient condition that X belong to this set is that X be a subset of E, it follows that if we change notation and call this set (P again, then CP = {X-.XczE}- The set (P is called the power set of E; the axiom of extension guarantees its uniqueness. The dependence of CP on E is denoted by writing 8'(E) in stead of just (P. Because the set <?(E) is very big in comparison with E, it is not easy to give examples. If E = 0, the situation is clear enough; the set CP(0) is 20 Sec. 5 NAIVE SET THEORY the singleton {0}. The power sets of singletons and pairs are also easily describable; we have <P({a}) = {0, {a}) and <P({a,&}) = \0, [a], {&}, {a, 6}}. The power set of a triple has eight elements. The reader can probably guess (and is hereby challenged to prove) the generalization that includes all these statements: the power set of a finite set with, say, n elements has 2" elements. (Of course concepts like "finite" and "2n" have no official standing for us yet; this should not prevent them from being unofficially understood.) The occurrence of n as an exponent' (the n-th power of 2) has something to do with the reason why a power• set bears its name. If 6 is a collection of subsets of a set E (that is, 6 is a subcollection of (P(2?)), then write » = {Xe<?(E):X'ee}. (To be certain that the condition used in the definition of 2D is a sentence in the precise technical sense, it must be rewritten in something like the form for some Y [Y « 6 and for all x (x eX if and only if (x eE and x e' Y))]. Similar comments often apply when we wish .to use defined abbreviations instead of logical and set-theoretic primitives only. The translation rarely requires any ingenuity and we shall usually omit it.) It is customary to denote the union and the intersection of the collection D by the symbols Ux.eX' and flx.e*'. In this notation the general forms of the De Morgan laws become (Ux.e*)' = rix.eX' and (Dx.eX)'- Ux.eX'. The proofs of these equations are immediate consequences of the appro priate definitions. Exercise. Prove that <P(E) D <P(F) = <P(E H F) and 6'(E) U <P(F) C <P(E U F). These assertions can be generalized to Oi.eW - <P(Dx.eX) and Ux.e (P(Z)C(P(Ux.eX); Sec. 5 COMPLEMENTS AND POWERS 21 find a reasonable interpretation of the notation in which these generaliza tions were here expressed and then prove them. Further elementary facts: ſlx. 90) X = 2, if E c F, then GP(E) c (P(F). and A curious question concerns the commutativity of the operators (P and U. Show that E is always equal to Ux.gº, X (that is E = U (P(E)), but that the result of applying (P and U to E in the other order is a set that includes E as a subset, typically a proper subset.
