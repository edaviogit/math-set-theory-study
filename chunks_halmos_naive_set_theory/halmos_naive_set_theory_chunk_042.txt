element x in X such that (c, a;) e U. The correspondence c — ► x thereby defined is a sequence of type a, say t, and t c U. If a does not belong to S, then (a, y) e U for some ?/ different from /(f). Assertion: the set U — { (a, ?/) } is /-closed. This means that if b e W and ifr is a sequence of type b included in U — {(a, y)\, then (b,/(r)) e U — {(a, y)}. Indeed, if b = a, then r must be < (by the uniqueness assertion of the theorem), and the reason the diminished set contains (b,f(r)) is that/(i) ^ y; if, on the other hand, Ma, then the reason the diminished set contains (b,f(r)) is that U is /-closed (and b a). This contradicts the fact that U is the smallest /-closed set, and we may conclude that a e S. The proof of the existence assertion of the transfinite recursion theorem is complete. An application of the transfinite recursion theorem is called definition by transfinite induction. We continue with an important part of the theory of order, which, inci dentally, will also serve as an illustration of how the transfinite recursion theorem can be applied. Two partially ordered sets (which may in particular be totally ordered and even well ordered) are called similar if there exists an order-preserving one-to-one correspondence between them. More explicitly: to say of the partially ordered sets X and Y that they are similar (in symbols X ^ Y) means that there exists a one-to-one correspondence, say /, from X onto Y, such that if a and b are in X, then a necessary and sufficient condition that /(a) ^ /(&) (in Y) is that a ^ b (in X). A correspordence such as / is sometimes called a similarity. Exercise. Prove that a similarity preserves < (in the same sense in which the definition demands the preservation of ^ ) and that, in fact, 72 Sec. 18 NAIVE SET THEORY one-to-one function that maps one partially ordered set onto another is a similarity if and only if it preserves <. The identity mapping on a partially ordered set X is a similarity from X onto X. If X and Y are partially ordered sets and if / is a similarity from X onto Y, then (since / is one-to-one) there exists an unambiguously determined inverse function /-1 from Y onto X, and /~ 1 is a similarity. If, moreover, g is a similarity from Y onto a partially ordered set Z, then the composite gf is a similarity from X onto Z. It follows from these comments that if we restrict attention to some particular set E, and if, accordingly, we consider only such partial orders whose domain is a subset of E, then similarity is an equivalence relation in the set of partially ordered sets so obtained. The same is true if we narrow the field even further and consider only well orderings whose domain is included in E; similarity is an equivalence relation in the set of well ordered sets so obtained. Al though similarity was defined for partially ordered sets in complete gen erality, and the subject can be studied on that level, our interest in what follows will be in similarity for well ordered sets only. It is easily possible for a well ordered set to be similar to a proper sub set; for an example consider the set of all natural numbers and the set of all even numbers. (As always, a natural number to is defined to be even if there exists a natural number n such that m = 2n. The mapping n — » 2n is a similarity from the set of all natural numbers onto the set of all even numbers.) A similarity of a well ordered set with a part of itself is, how ever, a very special kind of mapping. If, in fact, / is a similarity of a well ordered set X into itself, then a ^ /(a) for each a in X. The proof is based directly on the definition of well ordering. If there are elements b such that f(b) < b, then there is a least one among them. If a < b, where b is that least one, then a ^ /(a); it follows, in particular, with a = /(6), that f(b) ^ f(f(b)). Since, however, f(b) < b, the order-preserving character of / implies that /(/(&)) < f(b).
