(If a and b are cardinal numbers, a <b means, of course, that a ^ b but a ^ b.) The definition of cardinal numbers can be approached in several different ways, each of which has its strong advocates. To keep the peace as long as possible, and to demonstrate that the essential properties of the concept are independent of the approach, we shall postpone the basic construction. We proceed, instead, to study the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. In the course of that study we shall make use of the connection, described above, between cardinal inequality and set domination; that much of a loan from the future will be enough for the purpose. If a and b are cardinal numbers, and if A and B are disjoint sets with card A = a and card B = b, we write, by definition, a + b = card (A U B). If C and D are disjoint sets with card C = a and card D = b, then A ~ C and B ~ D; it follows that A U B ~ C U D, and hence that a + b is un ambiguously defined, independently of the arbitrary choice of A and B. Cardinal addition, thus defined, is commutative (a + b = 6 + a), and associative (a + (6 + c) = (a + b) + c) ; these identities are immediate consequences of the corresponding facts about the formation of unions. 94 Sec. 24 95 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC Exercise. Prove that if a, b, c, and d are cardinal numbers such that a < b and c ^ d, then a + c ^b + d. There is no difficulty about defining addition for infinitely many sum- mands. If {a,} is a family of cardinal numbers, and if {Ai} is a corre spondingly indexed family of pairwise disjoint sets such that card Ai = ai for each i, then we write, by definition, 2<Oi = card (U.^,). As before, the definition is unambiguous. To define the product ab of two cardinal numbers a and b, we find sets A and B with card A = a and card B = b, and we write ab = card (A X B). The replacement of A and B by equivalent sets yields the same value of the product. Alternatively, we could have defined ab by "adding a to itself b times"; this refers to the formation of the infinite sum ?j.t a,-, where the index set I has cardinal number b, and where a,- = a for each i in I. The reader should have no difficulty in verifying that this proposed alternative definition is indeed equivalent to the one that uses Cartesian products. Cardinal multiplication is commutative (ab = ba) and associative (a(bc) = (ab)c), and multiplication distributes over addition (a(b + c) = ab + ac); the proofs are elementary. Exercise. Prove that if a, b, c, and d are cardinal numbers such that a ^ b and c t= d, then ac ^ bd. There is no difficulty about defining multiplication for infinitely many factors. If {at} is a family of cardinal numbers, and if {Ai} is a correspond ingly indexed family of sets such that card Ai = o,- for each t, then we write, by definition, II< a.- = card (X, ^.)- The definition is unambiguous. Exercise. If {a,J (i < /) and {6< } (t e 1) are families of cardinal num bers such that ai < 6, for each i in I, then 2, a, < II, We can go from products to exponents the same way as we went from sums to products. The definition of ab, for cardinal numbers a and b, is most profitably given directly, but an alternative approach goes via re peated multiplication. For the direct definition, find sets A and B with card A = a and card B = b, and write ab = card AB. Alternatively, to define ab "multiply a by itself b times." More precisely: form Ili.jOi, where the index set / has cardinal number b, and where a,- = a for each i 96 Sec. 24 NAIVE SET THEORY in /. The familiar laws of exponents hold. That is, if a, b, and c are car dinal numbers, then ab+e = abac, (ab)e = acbc, a* = (ab)e. Exercise. Prove that if a, b, and c are cardinal numbers such that a < b, then ac ^ bc. Prove that if a and b are finite, greater than 1, and if c is infinite, then ac = bc. The preceding definitions and their consequences are reasonably straight forward and not at all surprising.
