e index set, the range of the function is called an indexed set, the function itself is called a family, and the value of the function x at an index i, called a term of the family, is denoted by x,-. (This terminology is not absolutely established, but it is one of the standard choices among related slight variants; in the sequel it and it alone will be used.) An unacceptable but generally accepted way of communicating the notation and indicating the emphasis is to speak of a family {a;,} in X, or of a family {xi} of whatever the elements of X may be; when necessary, the index set / is indicated by some such parenthetical expression as (i e I). Thus, for instance, the phrase "a family {A,} of subsets of X" is usually understood to refer to a function A, from some set I of indices, into (P(X). If {Aj} is a family of subsets of X, the union of the range of the family is called the union of the family {-A,-}, or the union of the sets A,-; the standard notation for it is Ui.iAi or U,A„ according as it is or is not important to emphasize the index set I. It follows immediately from the definition of unions that x « U, A, if and only if x belongs to A,- for at least one i. If I = 2, so that the range of the family {A,} is the unordered pair {A0, Ai\, then U, A,- = A0 U A\. Observe that there is no loss of generality in considering families of sets instead of arbitrary collections of sets; every collection of sets is the range 34 Sec. 9 35 FAMILIES of some family. If, indeed, e is a collection of sets, let 6 itself play the role of the index set, and consider the identity mapping on e in the role of the family. The algebraic laws satisfied by the operation of union for pairs can be generalized to arbitrary unions. Suppose, for instance, that {Ij} is a fam ily of sets with domain J, say; write K = Ui Ij' an<^ ^ M*} be a family of sets with domain K. It is then not difficult to prove that \Jk.K Ak = \J,.j (Ui.ii this is the generalized version of the associative law for unions. Exercise: formulate and prove a generalized version of the commutative law. An empty union makes sense (and is empty), but an empty intersection does not make sense. Except for this triviality, the terminology and nota tion for intersections parallels that for unions in every respect. Thus, for instance, if {A,} is a non-empty family of sets, the intersection of the range of the family is called the intersection of the family {A.,}, or the intersec tion of the sets A*; the standard notation for it is or fli^i, according as it is or is not important to emphasize the index set I. (By a "non-empty family" we mean a family whose domain I is not empty.) It follows immediately from the definition of intersections that if 1^0, then a necessary and sufficient condition that x belong to P|< A< is that x belong to A,- for all i. The generalized commutative and associative laws for intersections can be formulated and proved the same way as for unions, or, alternatively, De Morgan's laws can be used to derive them from the facts for unions. This is almost obvious, and, therefore, it is not of much interest. The in teresting algebraic identities are the ones that involve both unions and intersections. Thus, for instance, if {Ai} is a family of subsets of X and BcX, then BD \JiAi= U. (Bf1 At) and B U fit Ai- n. (5 U At); these equations are a mild generalization of the distributive laws. Exercise. If both {A,} and {By} are families of sets, then (IM.) n (UyBy) = UijUiHBj) and (Hi ^) U (f|y By) = n,.i (Ai U B,). 36 Sec. 9 NAIVE SET THEORY Explanation of notation: a symbol such as U,.y is an abbreviation for U(,V)«rx/- The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets X and Y was defined as the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) with x in X and y in Y. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and a cer tain set of families.
