ch element of T (other than w itself) can be obtained from w by the repeated formation of successors. To formulate this requirement more precisely we introduce some special and temporary terminology. Let us say that a function / whose domain is the set of strict predecessors of some natural number n (in other words, dom/ = n) is an u-successor function if /(0) = w (provided that n 5* 0, so that 0 < n), and/(to+) = (f(m)) + whenever m+ < n. An easy proof by mathematical induction shows that for each natural number n there exists a unique w-successor function with domain n. To say that something is either equal to w or can be obtained from w by the repeated formation of successors means that it belongs to the range of some w-suc cessor function. Let S(n, x) be the sentence that says "n is a natural number and x belongs to the range of the w-successor function with do main n." A set T such that x e T if and only if S(n, x) is true for some n is what we are looking for; such a set is as far beyond w as w is beyond 0. We know that for each natural number n we are permitted to form the set {x: S(n, x)}. In other words, for each natural number n, there exists a set F(n) such that x e F(n) if and only if S(n, x) is true. The connection between n and F(n) looks very much like a function. It turns out, how 74 Sec. 19 75 ORDINAL NUMBERS ever, that none of the methods of set construction that we have seen so far is sufficiently strong to prove the existence of a set F of ordered pairs such that (n, x) e F if and only if x e F(n). To achieve this obviously de sirable state of affairs, we need one more set-theoretic principle (our last). The new principle says, roughly speaking, that anything intelligent that one can do to the elements of a set yields a set. Axiom of substitution. If S(a, b) is a sentence such that for each a in a set A the set {6: S(a, b) } can be formed, then there exists a function F with domain A such that F(a) = {b: S(a, 6)} for each a in A. To say that {b: S(a, b) ) can be formed means, of course, that there exists a set F(a) such that b e F(a) if and only if S(a, b) is true. The axiom of extension implies that the function described in the axiom of substitution is uniquely determined by the given sentence and the given set. The rea son for the name of the axiom is that it enables us to make a new set out of an old one by substituting something new for each element of the old. The chief application of the axiom of substitution is in extending the process of counting far beyond the natural numbers. From the present point of view, the crucial property of a natural number is that it is a well ordered set such that the initial segment determined by each element is equal to that element. (Recall that if m and n are natural numbers, then m < n means men; this implies that {m e w. m < n} = n.) This is the property on which the extended counting process is based; the fundamen tal definition in this circle of ideas is due to von Neumann. An ordinal number is defined as a well ordered set a such that s(£) = £ for all £ in a; here s(£) is, as before, the initial segment \r) e a: ij < £}. An example of an ordinal number that is not a natural number is the set u consisting of all the natural numbers. This means that we can al ready "count" farther than we could before; whereas before the only numbers at our disposal were the elements of w, now we have w itself. We have also the successor w+ of w; this set is ordered in the obvious way, and, moreover, the obvious ordering is a well ordering that satisfies the condi tion imposed on ordinal numbers. Indeed, if £ «to+, then, by the defini tion of successor, either £ « w, in which case we already know that s(£) = £, or else £ = w, in which case s(£) = w, by the definition of order, so that again s(£) = £. The argument just presented is quite general; it proves that if a is an ordinal number, then so is a +.
