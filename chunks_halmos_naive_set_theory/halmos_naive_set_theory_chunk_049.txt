ular choice of the sets A and B; any other pair of disjoint sets, with the same ordinal numbers, would have given the same result. These considerations extend without difficulty to the infinite case. If {a,-} is a well ordered family of ordinal numbers indexed by a well ordered set /, let {Ai\ be a disjoint family of well ordered sets with ord Ai = a,- for each t, and let A be the ordinal sum of the family {Ai}. The sum ord Ai is, by definition, the ordinal number of A, so that 0T^ A-i Sec. 21 83 ORDINAL ARITHMETIC = ord A. Here too the final result is independent of the arbitrary choice of the well ordered sets At\ any other choices (with the same ordinal num bers) Would have given the same sum. Some of the properties of addition for ordinal numbers are good and others are bad. On the good side of the ledger are the identities a + 0 = a, 0 + a = a, a + 1 = a+ and the associative law « + 03 + T) = (« + /?) + y. Equally laudable is the fact that a < /3 if and only if there exists an ordinal number y different from 0 such that 0 = a + 7. The proofs of all these assertions are elementary. Almost all the bad behavior of addition stems from the failure of the commutative law. Sample: 1 + w = w (but, as we saw just above, w + 1 ^u). The misbehavior of addition expresses some intuitively clear facts about order. If, for instance, we tack a new element in front of an infinite sequence (of type w), the result is clearly similar to what we started with, but if we tack it on at the end instead, then we have ruined similar ity; the old set had no last element but the new set has one. The main use of infinite sums is to motivate and facilitate the study of products. If A and B are well ordered sets, it is natural to define their product as the result of adding A to itself B times. To make sense out of this, we must first of all manufacture a disjoint family of well ordered sets, each of which is similar to A, indexed by the set B. The general pre scription for doing this works well here; all we need to do is to write Ab = A X [b] for each b in B. If now we examine the definition of ordinal sum as it applies to the family {Aj,}, we are led to formulate the following defini tion. The ordinal product of two well ordered sets A and B is the Cartesian product A X B with the reverse lexicographic order. In other words, if (a, b) and (c, d) are in A X B, then (a, b) < (c, d) means that either b < d or else b = d and a < c. If a and /3 are ordinal numbers, let A and B be well ordered sets with ord A = a and ord B = fi, and let C be the ordinal product of A and B. The product aff is, by definition, the ordinal number of C, so that (ord A) (ord B) = ordC. The product is unambiguously defined, inde pendently of the arbitrary choice of the well ordered sets A and B. Alter natively, at this point we could have avoided any arbitrariness at all by 84 Sec. 21 NAIVE SET THEORY recalling that the most easily available well ordered set whose ordinal number is a is the ordinal number a itself (and similarly for /3). Like addition, multiplication has its good and bad properties. Among the good ones are the identities oO = 0, 0a = 0, al = a, la — a, the associative law a(fiy) = (afly, the left distributive law a(0 + y) = «/3 + ay, and the fact that if the product of two ordinal numbers is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. (Note that we use the standard convention about multiplication taking precedence over addition; a(} + ay denotes (o0) + (ay).) The commutative law for multiplication fails, and so do many of its consequences. Thus, for instance, 2w = w (think of an infinite sequence of ordered pairs), but w2 ^ u (think of an ordered pair of infinite se quences). The right distributive law also fails; that is (a + f))y is in gen eral different from ay + f)y. Example: (1 + l)w = 2w = w, but lw + lw = w + w = w2. Just as repeated addition led to the definition of ordinal products, re peated multiplication could be used to define ordinal exponents.
