on of /. If we recall that the functions in F are, after all, certain subsets of the Cartesian product X X Y, we recognize that fRg means the same as / C jr; extension is a special case of inclusion. A partially ordered set is a set together with a partial order in it. A pre cise formulation of this "togetherness" goes as follows: a partially ordered set is an ordered pair (X, where X is a set and ^ is a partial order in X. This kind of definition is very common in mathematics; a mathemati cal structure is almost always a set "together" with some specified other sets, functions, and relations. The accepted way of making such defini tions precise is by reference to ordered pairs, triples, or whatever is appro priate. That is not the only way. Observe, for instance, that knowledge of a partial order implies knowledge of its domain. If, therefore, we de scribe a partially ordered set as an ordered pair, we are being quite re dundant; the second coordinate alone would have conveyed the same amount of information. In matters of language and notation, however, tradition always conquers pure reason. The accepted mathematical be havior (for structures in general, illustrated here for partially ordered sets) is to admit that ordered pairs are the right approach, to forget that the second coordinate is the important one, and to speak as if the first coordi nate were all that mattered. Following custom, we shall often say some thing like "let X be a partially ordered set," when what we really mean is "let X be the domain of a partial order." The same linguistic conventions apply to totally ordered sets, i.e., to partially ordered sets whose order is in fact total. The theory of partially ordered sets uses many words whose technical meaning is so near to their everyday connotation that they are almost self- explanatory. Suppose, to be specific, that X is a partially ordered set and that x and y are elements of X. We write y ^ x in case x :S y; in other words, ^ is the inverse of the relation ^ . If x < y and x j± y, we write x < y and we say that x is less than or smaller than y, or that x is a predeces sor of y. Alternatively, under the same circumstances, we write y > x and we say that y is greater or larger than x, or y is a successor of x. The relation < is such that (i) for no elements x and y do x < y and y < x hold simul 56 Sec. 14 NAIVE SET THEORY taneously, and (ii) if x < y and y < z, then x < z (i.e., < is transitive). If, conversely, < is a relation in X satisfying (i) and (ii), and if x ^ y is denned to mean that either x < y or x = y, then ^ is a partial order in X. The connection between ^ and < can be generalized to arbitrary rela tions. That is, given any relation 2. in a set X, we can define a relation S in X by writing x S y in case xRy but x ^ y, and, vice versa, given any relation S in X, we can define a relation R in X by writing x R y in case either x S y or x = y. To have an abbreviated way of referring to the passage from R to S and back, we shall say that S is the strict relation corresponding to R, and R is the weak relation corresponding to S. We shall say of a relation in a set X that it "partially orders X" in case either it is a partial order in X or else the corresponding weak relation is one. If X is a partially ordered set, and if a e X, the set {x e X: x < a] is the initial segment determined by a; we shall usually denote it by s(a). The set {x e X: x ^ a] is the weak initial segment determined by a, and will be denoted by s(a). When it is important to emphasize the distinction be tween initial segments and weak initial segments, the former will be called strict initial segments. In general the words "strict" and "weak" refer to < and ^ respectively.
