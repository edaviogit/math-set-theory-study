^ bc. Prove that if a and b are finite, greater than 1, and if c is infinite, then ac = bc. The preceding definitions and their consequences are reasonably straight forward and not at all surprising. If they are restricted to finite sets only, the result is the familiar finite arithmetic. The novelty of the subject arises in the formation of sums, products, and powers in which at least one term is infinite. The words "finite" and "infinite" are used here in a very natural sense: a cardinal number is finite if it is the cardinal number of a finite set, and infinite otherwise. If a and b are cardinal numbers such that a is finite and 6 is infinite, then a + b = b. For the proof, suppose that A and B are disjoint sets such that A is equiv alent to some natural number k and B is infinite; we are to prove that A U fi~5. Since u B, we may and do assume that oi C B. We de fine a mapping / from A U B to B as follows: the restriction of / to A is a one-to-one correspondence between A and k, the restriction of / to w is given by f(n) = n + k for all n, and the restriction of / to B — co is the identity mapping on B — u. Since the result is a one-to-one correspond ence between A U B and B, the proof is complete. Next: if a is an infinite cardinal number, then a + a = a. For the proof, let A be a set with card A — a. Since the set A X 2 is the union of two disjoint sets equivalent to A (namely, A X {0} and A X { 1 ) ), it would be sufficient to prove that A X 2 is equivalent to A. The ap proach we shall use will not quite prove that much, but it will come close enough. The idea is to approximate the construction of the desired one-to- one correspondence by using larger and larger subsets of A. Precisely speaking, let SF be the collection of all functions / such that the domain of / is of the form X X 2, for some subset X of A, and such that / is a one-to-one correspondence between X X 2 and X. If X is a count Sec. 24 97 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC ably infinite subset of A, then XX2~I. This implies that the collec tion SF is not empty; at the very least it contains the one-to-one corre spondences between X X 2 and X for the countably infinite subsets X of A. The collection is partially ordered by extension. Since a straight forward verification shows that the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are satis fied, it follows that SF contains a maximal element / with ran f = X, say. Assertion: A — X is finite. If A — X were infinite, then it would in clude a countably infinite set, say Y. By combining / with a one-to-one correspondence between Y X 2 and Y we could obtain a proper extension of /, in contradiction to the assumed maximality. Since card X + card X = card X, and since card A = card X + card (A — X), the fact that A — X is finite completes the proof that card A + card A = card A. Here is one more result in additive cardinal arithmetic: if a and b are cardinal numbers at least one of which is infinite, and if c is equal to the larger one of a and b, then a + b = c. Suppose that b is infinite, and let A and B be disjoint sets with card A = a and card B = b. Since a ^ c and b ^ c, it follows that a + b ^ c + c, and since c ^ card (A U B), it follows that c ^ a + b. The result fol lows from the antisymmetry of the ordering of cardinal numbers. The principal result in multiplicative cardinal arithmetic is that if a is an infinite cardinal number, then O•O = o. The proof resembles the proof of the corresponding additive fact. Let be the collection of all functions / such that the domain of / is of the form X X X for some subset X of A, and such that / is a one-to-one correspond ence between X X X and X. If X is a countably infinite subset of A, then XXl^I This implies that the collection is not empty; at the very least it contains the one-to-one correspondences between X X X and X for the countably infinite subsets X of A. The collection J is partially ordered by extension.
