t constitute a set. Despite the maxim about never getting something for nothing, it seems a little harsh to be told that certain sets are not really sets and even their names must never be mentioned. Some approaches to set theory try to soften the blow by making systematic use of such illegal sets but just not calling them sets; the customary word is "class." A precise explanation of what classes really are and how they are used is irrelevant in the present approach. Roughly speaking, a class may be identified with a condition (sentence), or, rather, with the "extension" of a condition. SECTION 4 UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS If A and B are sets, it is sometimes natural to wish to unite their ele ments into one comprehensive set. One way of describing such a com prehensive set is to require it to contain all the elements that belong to at least one of the two members of the pair {.A, B). This formulation sug gests a sweeping generalization of itself; surely a similar construction should apply to arbitrary collections of sets and not just to pairs of them. What is wanted, in other words, is the following principle of set construc tion. Axiom of unions. For every collection of sets there exists a set that con tains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the given collection. Here it is again: for every collection 6 there exists a set U such that if x e X for some X in 6, then x « U. (Note that "at least one" is the same as "some.") The comprehensive set U described above may be too comprehensive; it may contain elements that belong to none of the sets X in the collection e. This is easy to remedy; just apply the axiom of specification to form the set {x e U: x e X for some X in Q] . (The condition here is a translation into idiomatic usage of the mathemati cally more acceptable "for some X (x « X and X e Q).") It follows that, for every x, a necessary and sufficient condition that x belong to this set is thatvE belong to X for some X in e. If we change notation and call the new set U again, then U = {x: x e X for some X in G}. This set U is called the union of the collection 6 of sets; note that tne 12 Sec. 4 13 UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS axiom of extension guarantees its uniqueness. The simplest symbol for U that is in use at all is not very popular in mathematical circles; it is U e. Most mathematicians prefer something like U [X:Xe 6} or Further alternatives are available in certain important special cases; they will be described in due course. For the time being we restrict our study of the theory of unions to the simplest facts only. The simplest fact of all is that U {X:X*0} = 0, and the next simplest fact is that U {A}} = A. In the brutally simple notation mentioned above these facts are expressed by U0 = 0 and U {A} = A. The proofs are immediate from the definitions. There is a little more substance in the union of pairs of sets (which is what started this whole discussion anyway). In that case special notation is used: U {X:Xe{A,B}} = A U B. The general definition of unions implies in the special case that x e A U B if and only if x belongs to either A or B or both; it follows that A U B = {x: x e A or x e B\. Here are some easily proved facts about the unions of pairs : A U 0 = A, A U B = B U A (commutativity), A U (B U C) = (A U B) U C (associativity), A U A = A (idempotence), AczBifand only if A U B = B. 14 Sec. 4 NAIVE SET THEORY Every student of mathematics should prove these things for himself at least once in his life. The proofs are based on the corresponding elemen tary properties of the logical operator or. An equally simple but quite suggestive fact is that {a} U {b} = [a,b\. What this suggests is the way to generalize pairs. Specifically, we write {a, b, c} - {a} U {6} U {c}. The equation defines its left side. The right side should by rights have at least one pair of parentheses in it, but, in view of the associative law, their omission can lead to no misunderstanding.
