an product of two sets X and Y was defined as the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) with x in X and y in Y. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and a cer tain set of families. Consider, indeed, any particular unordered pair {a, b], with a 9* b, and consider the set Z of all families z, indexed by {a, 6}, such that za e X and z& « Y. If the function / from Z to X X Y is defined by /(z) = (z0, Zj), then / is the promised one-to-one correspond ence. The difference between Z and X X Y is merely a matter of nota tion. The generalization of Cartesian products generalizes Z rather than X X Y itself. (As a consequence there is a little terminological friction in the passage from the special case to the general. There is no help for it; that is how mathematical language is in fact used nowadays.) The generalization is now straightforward. If {X,} is a family of sets (i e 1), the Cartesian product of the family is, by definition, the set of all families \xi) with xi e Xi for each i in /. There are several symbols for the Carte sian product in more or less current usage; in this book we shall denote it by It is clear that if every X,- is equal to one and the same set X, then X, ^, = X1. If / is a pair {a, 6 J, with a b, then it is customary to identify X, €jX,- with the Cartesian product Xa X Xb as defined earlier, and if/ is a singleton {a}, then, similarly, we identify X,«/ X, with. Xa itself. Ordered triples, ordered quadruples, etc., may be defined as families whose index sets are unordered triples, quadruples, etc. Suppose that [Xi] is a family of sets (i e 1) and let X be its Cartesian product. If J is a subset of J, then to each element of X there corresponds in a natural way an element of the partial Cartesian product X<«/X,- To define the correspondence, recall that each element x of X is itself a family {xi}, that is, in the last analysis, a function on /; the corresponding element, say y, of X<«/ Xi m obtained by simply restricting that function to J. Explicitly, we write y,- = xi whenever i e J. The correspondence x — > y is called the projection from X onto X,"«/ we shall temporarily denote it by //. If, in particular, J is a singleton, say «/ = then we shall write /y (instead of /(/)) for//. The word "projection" has a multiple use; if x e X, the value of at x, that is xj, is also called the projection of x onto Xj, or, alternatively, the j-coordinote of x. A function on a Carte Sec. 9 37 FAMILIES sian product such as X is called a function of several variables, and, in par ticular, a function on a Cartesian product Xa X -Xj is called a function of two variables. Exercise. Prove that (U. At) X (Ui Bj) = U..j X B,), and that the same equation holds for intersections (provided that the domains of the families involved are not empty). Prove also (with appropriate provisos about empty families) that f")i %i c Xj c U, Xf f°r each in dex j and that intersection and union can in fact be characterized as the extreme solutions of these inclusions. This means that if Xj (Z Y for each index j, then U, Xi c Y, and that U, X% is the only set satisfying this minimality condition; the formulation for intersections is similar. SECTION 10 INVERSES AND COMPOSITES Associated with every function /, from X to Y, say, there is a function from <P(X) to <P(Y), namely the function (frequently called / also) that assigns to each subset A of X the image subset f(A) of Y. The algebraic behavior of the mapping A —* f(A) leaves something to be desired. It is true that if {A,} is a family of subsets of X, then /(U<A,) = U,/C^,) (proof?), but the corresponding equation for intersections is false in gen eral (example?), and the connection between images and complements is equally unsatisfactory.
