. The equation defines its left side. The right side should by rights have at least one pair of parentheses in it, but, in view of the associative law, their omission can lead to no misunderstanding. Since it is easy to prove that {a,b,c} = {x: x = a or x = b or x = c] , we know now that for every three sets there exists a set that contains them and nothing else; it is natural to call that uniquely determined set the (unordered) triple formed by them. The extension of the notation and terminology thus introduced to more terms (quadruples, etc.) is obvious. The formation of unions has many points of similarity with another set- theoretic operation. If A and B are sets, the intersection of A and B is the set AD B defined by A r\ B = {xeA:xeB}. The definition is symmetric in A and B even if it looks otherwise; we have A f) B = {xeB-.xeA}, and, in fact, since xe A fl B if and only if x belongs to both A and B, it follows that A ft B = {x: x e A and x e B\. The basic facts about intersections, as well as their proofs, are similar to the basic facts about unions: A fl 0 = 0, a n B = B n A, a n (B n o - (a n b) n c, A fl A = A, A (Z B if and only if A fl B = A. Sec. 4 15 UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS Pairs of sets with an empty intersection occur frequently enough to justify the use of a special word: if A D B = 0, the sets A and B are called disjoint. The same word is sometimes applied to a collection of sets to indicate that any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint; alterna tively we may speak in such a situation of a pairwise disjoint collection. Two useful facts about unions and intersections involve both the opera tions at the same time: These identities are called the distributive laws. By way of a sample of a set-theoretic proof, we prove the second one. If x belongs to the left side, then x belongs either to A or to both B and C; if x is in A, then x is in both A U B and A U C, and if x is in both B and C, then, again, x is in both A U B and A U C ; it follows that, in any case, x belongs to the right side. This proves that the right side includes the left. To prove the reverse in clusion, just observe that if x belongs to both A U B and A U C, then x belongs either to A or to both B and C. The formation of the intersection of two sets A and B, or, we might as well say, the formation of the intersection of a pair {A, B) of sets, is a special case of a much more general operation. (This is another respect in which the theory of intersections imitates that of unions.) The existence of the general operation of intersection depends on the fact that for each non-empty collection of sets there exists a set that contains exactly those elements that belong to every set of the given collection. In other words: for each collection Q, other than 0, there exists a set V such that x e V if and only if x e X for every X in 6. To prove this assertion, let A be any particular set in 6 (this step is justified by the fact that Q ^ 0) and write (The condition means "for all X (if X e Q, then x e X).") The dependence of V on the arbitrary choice of A is illusory; in fact The set V is called the intersection of the collection e of sets; the axiom of extension guarantees its uniqueness. The customary notation is similar to the one for unions: instead of the unobjectionable but unpopular a n (b u o = (A n B) u (A n c), V = {x e A: x e X for every X in Q} . V = {x: x e X for every X in 6} . 16 Sec. 4 NAIVE SET THEORY the set V is usually denoted by PI {X:X*e} or Exercise. A necessary and sufficient condition that (A D B) U C = A fl (B U C) is that Cc A. Observe that the condition has nothing to do with the set B. SECTION 5 COMPLEMENTS AND POWERS If A and B are sets, the difference between A and B, more often known as the relative complement of B in A, is the set A — B defined by A - B = {xeA-.xe'B}. Note that in this definition it is not necessary to assume that Be A.
