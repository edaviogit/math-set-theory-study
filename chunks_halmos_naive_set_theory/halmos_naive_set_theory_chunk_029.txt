tion) = fc + (to + n+) (ditto), and the argument is complete. The proof that addition is commutative (i.e., to + n = n + to f or all to and n) is a little tricky; a straightforward attack might fail. The trick is to prove, by in duction on n, that (i) 0 + n = n and (ii) m+ + n = (to + n) +, and then to prove the desired commutativity equation by induction on to, via (i) and (ii). Similar techniques are applied in the definitions of products and expo nents and in the derivations of their basic arithmetic properties. To define multiplication, apply the recursion theorem to produce functions pm such that Pm(0) = 0 and such that pm(n+) = pm(n) + to for every natural num ber n; then the value pm(n) is, by definition, the product m-n. (The dot is frequently omitted.) Multiplication is associative and commutative; the 50 Sec. 13 51 ARITHMETIC proofs are straightforward adaptations of the ones that worked for addi tion. The distributive law (i.e., the assertion that k-(m + n) = k-m + k-n whenever k, to, and n are natural numbers) is another easy consequence of the principle of mathematical induction. (Use induction on n.) Anyone who has worked through sums and products in this way should have no trouble with exponents. The recursion theorem yields functions em such that em(0) = 1 and such that em(n+) = em(n) •m for every natural number n; the value em(n) is, by definition, the power to". The discovery and estab lishment of the properties of powers, as well as the detailed proofs of the statements about products, can safely be left as exercises for the reader. The next topic that deserves some attention is the theory of order in the set of natural numbers. For this purpose we proceed to examine with some care the question of which natural numbers belong to which others. Formally, we say that two natural numbers to and n are comparable if men, or to = n, or n « to. Assertion : two natural numbers are always comparable. The proof of this assertion consists of several steps; it will be convenient to introduce some notation. For each n in w, write S(n) for the set of all to in w that are comparable with n, and let S be the set of all those n for which S(n) = u. In these terms, the assertion is that S = w. We begin the proof by showing that S(0) = w (i.e., that 0 eS). Clearly S(0) contains 0. If to « <S(0), then, since to « 0 is impossible, either to = 0 (in which case 0 e to+), or 0 « to (in which case, again, 0 « to+). Hence, in all cases, if to « <S(0), then m+ e S(0) ; this proves that S(0) = w. We com plete the proof by showing that if S(n) = w, then S(n+) = u. The fact that 0 eS(n+) is immediate (since n+ «<S(0)); it remains to prove that if m e S(n+), then m+ « S(n+). Since to e S(n+), therefore either n+ e m (in which case n+ « to+), or n+ = to (ditto), or to « n+. In the latter case, either to = n (in which case m+ = n+), or to « n. The last case, in turn, splits according to the behavior of m+ and n: since m+ eS(n), we must have either n e m+, or n = to+, or to+ « n. The first possibility is incom patible with the present situation (i.e., with men). The reason is that if n e m+, then either n e m or n = to, so that, in any case, n C to, and we know that no natural number is a subset of one of its elements. Both the remaining possibilities imply that m+ e n+, and the proof is complete. The preceding paragraph implies that if to and n are in w, then at least one of the three possibilities (to « n, to = n, n « to) must hold; it is easy to see that, in fact, always exactly one of them holds. (The reason is another application of the fact that a natural number is not a subset of one of its elements.) Another consequence of the preceding paragraph is that if n and m are distinct natural numbers, then a necessary and sufficient condi 52 Sec. 13 NAIVE SET THEORY tion that m en is that to C n. Indeed, the implication from toen to m C n is just the transitivity of n.
