ometimes a set with the property that it includes (c) everything that it contains (e) is called a transitive set. More precisely, to say that E is transitive means that if x e y and y eE, then x e E. (Recall the slightly different use of the word that we encountered in the theory of relations.) In this language, (ii) says that every natural number is transitive. The proof of (i) is a typical application of the principle of mathematical induction. Let S be the set of all those natural numbers n that are not included in any of their elements. (Explicitly: n « S if and only if n e u and n is not a subset of x for any x in n.) Since 0 is not a subset of any of its elements, it follows that 0 « S. Suppose now that n eS. Since n is a subset of n, we may infer that n is not an element of n, and hence that n+ is not a subset of n. What can n+ be a subset of. If n+ C x, then n C x, and therefore (since n eS) x e' n. It follows that n+ cannot be a subset of n, and n+ cannot be a subset of any element of n. This means that n+ cannot be a subset of any element of n+, and hence that n+ « S. The de sired conclusion (i) is now a consequence of (III). The proof of (ii) is also inductive. This time let S be the set of all transitive natural numbers. (Explicitly: n e S if and only if n « w and x is a subset of n for every x in n.) The requirement that 0 e S is vacuously satisfied. Suppose now that n eS. If x e n+, then either x en or x = n. In the first case x C n (since n eS) and therefore i C n+; in the second case x <z n+ for even more trivial reasons. It follows that every element of n+ is a subset of n+, or, in other words, that n+ e S. The desired con clusion (ii) is a consequence of (III). We are now ready to prove (V). Suppose indeed that n and m are natural numbers and that n+ = m+. Since n e n+, it follows that n e m+, and hence that either n e m or n = m. Similarly, either m e n or m = n. If n j± m, then we must have n em and men. Since, by (ii), n is transi tive, it follows that n en. Since, however, n C n, this contradicts (i), and the proof is complete. The assertions (I)-(V) are known as the Peano axioms; they used to be considered as the fountainhead of all mathematical knowledge. From 48 Sec. 12 NAIVE SET THEORY them (together with the set-theoretic principles we have already met) it is possible to define integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, and to derive their usual arithmetic and analytic properties. Such a program is not within the scope of this book; the interested reader should have no difficulty in locating and studying it elsewhere. Induction is often used not only to prove things but also to define things. Suppose, to be specific, that / is a function from a set X into the same set X, and suppose that a is an element of X. It seems natural to try to define an infinite sequence {«(n)j of elements of X (that is, a function u from w to X) in some such way as this: write w(0) = a, u{\) = /(w(0)), w(2) = /(u(l)), and so on. If the would-be definer were pressed to explain the "and so on," he might lean on induction. What it all means, he might say, is that we define w(0) as a, and then, inductively, we define u(n+) as /(w(n)) for every n. This may sound plausible, but, as justification for an existential assertion, it is insufficient. The principle of mathematical in duction does indeed prove, easily, that there can be at most one function satisfying all the stated conditions, but it does not establish the existence of such a function. What is needed is the following result. Recursion theorem. If a is an element of a set X, and iff is a function from X into X, then there exists a function u from u into X such that w(0) = a and such that u(n+) = f(u(n)) for all n in w. Proof. Recall that a function from w to X is a certain kind of subset of u X X; we shall construct u explicitly as a set of ordered pairs.
