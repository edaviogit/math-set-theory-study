r then we should have w n, and that contradicts the fact that o is infinite.) We have just seen that a set X is infinite if and only if w X; next we shall prove that X is finite if and only if X < u. The proof depends on the transitivity of strict domination: if X £ Y and Y £ Z, and if at least one of these dominations is strict, then X < Z. Indeed, clearly, X < Z. If we had Z X, then we should have Y & X and Z & Y and hence (by the Schroder-Bernstein theorem) X ~ Y and Y ~ Z, in contradiction to the assumption of strict domination. If now X is finite, then X ~ n for some natural number n, and, since w is infinite, n < w, so that X < w. 90 Sec. 23 91 COUNTABLE SETS If, conversely, X < «, then X must be finite, for otherwise we should have u ^ X, and hence u < w, which is absurd. A set X is called countable (or denumerable) in case X u and countably infinite in case X ~ w. Clearly a countable set is either finite or countably infinite. Our main purpose in the immediate sequel is to show that many set-theoretic constructions when performed on countable sets lead again to countable sets. We begin with the observation that every subset of w is countable, and we go on to deduce that every subset of each countable set is countable. These facts are trivial but useful. If/ is a function from u onto a set X, then X is countable. For the proof, observe that for each x in X the set/-i({a;}) is not empty (this is where the onto character of / is important), and consequently, for each x in X, we may find a natural number g(x) such that f(g(x)) = x. Since the function g is a one-to-one mapping from X into w, this proves that X ^ w. The reader who worries about such things might have noticed that this proof made use of the axiom of choice, and he may want to know that there is an alternative proof that does not depend on that axiom. (There is.) The same comment applies on a few other occasions in this section and its successors but we shall refrain from making it. It follows from the preceding paragraph that a set X is countable if and only if there exists a function from some countable set onto X. A closely related result is this: if Y is any particular countably infinite set, then a necessary and sufficient condition that a non-empty set X be countable is that there exist a function from Y onto X. The mapping n —►2n is a one-to-one correspondence between u and the set A of all even numbers, so that A is countably infinite. This implies that if X is a countable set, then there exists a function / that maps A onto X. Since, similarly, the mapping n —* 2n + 1 is a one-to-one cor respondence between u and the set B of all odd numbers, it follows that if Y is a countable set, then there exists a function g that maps B onto Y. The function h that agrees with / on A and with g on B (i.e., h(x) = f(x) when x e A and h(x) = g(x) when x e B) maps w onto X U Y. Conclu sion: the union of two countable sets is countable. From here on an easy argument by mathematical induction proves that the union of a finite set of countable sets is countable. The same result can be obtained by imitat ing the trick that worked for two sets; the basis of the method is the fact that for each non-zero natural number n there exists a pairwise disjoint family {A,} (i < n) of infinite subsets of u whose union is equal to w. The same method can be used to prove still more. Assertion: there 92 Sec. 23 NAIVE SET THEORY exists a pairwise disjoint family \An] (n < w) of infinite subsets of w whose union is equal to w. One way to prove this is to write down the elements of w in an infinite array by counting down the diagonals, thus: 0 1 3 6 10 2 4 7 11 16 5 8 12 17 9 13 18 14 19 ... 20 • • ■ and then to consider the sequence of the rows of this array. Another way is to let A0 consist of 0 and the odd numbers, let Ai be the set obtained by doubling each non-zero element of Ao, and, inductively, let .An+1 be the set obtained by doubling each element of An, n ^ 1.
