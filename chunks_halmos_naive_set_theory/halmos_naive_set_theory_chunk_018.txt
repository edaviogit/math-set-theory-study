tions in the precise set-theoretic sense of the word in both mathematics and everyday life; all we have to look for is information, not necessarily numerical, in tabulated form. One example 1 30 Sec. 8 31 FUNCTIONS is a city directory; the arguments of the function are, in this case, the in habitants of the city, and the values are their addresses. For relations in general, and hence for functions in particular, we have denned the concepts of domain and range. The domain of a function / from X into Y is, by definition, equal to X, but its range need not be equal to Y; the range consists of those elements y of Y for which there exists an x in X such that f(x) = y. If the range of / is equal to Y, we say that / maps X onto Y. If A is a subset of X, we may want to consider the set of all those elements y of Y for which there exists an x in the subset A such that f(x) = y. This subset of Y is called the image of A under / and is frequently denoted by /(.A). The notation is bad but not catastrophic. What is bad about it is that if A happens to be both an element of X and a subset of X (an unlikely situation, but far from an impossible one), then the symbol f(A) is ambiguous. Does it mean the value of / at A or does it mean the set of values of / at the elements of A. Following normal math ematical custom, we shall use the bad notation, relying on context, and, on the rare occasions when it is necessary, adding verbal stipulations, to avoid confusion. Note that the image of X itself is the range of /; the "onto" character of/ can be expressed by writing /(X) = Y. If X is a subset of a set Y, the function / defined by f(x) = x for each x in X is called the inclusion map (or the embedding, or the injection) of X into Y. The phrase "the function / defined by . . ." is a very common one in such contexts. It is intended to imply, of course, that there does indeed exist a unique function satisfying the stated condition. In the spe cial case at hand this is obvious enough; we are being invited to consider the set of all those ordered pairs (x, y) in X X Y for which x = y. Similar considerations apply in every case, and, following normal mathematical practice, we shall usually describe a function by describing its value y at each argument x. Such a description is sometimes longer and more cum bersome than a direct description of the set (of ordered pairs) involved, but, nevertheless, most mathematicians regard the argument-value de scription as more perspicuous than any other. The inclusion map of X into X is called the identity map on X. (In the language of relations, the identity map on X is the same as the relation of equality in X.) If, as before, X C F, then there is a connection between the inclusion map of X into Y and the identity map on Y; that connection is a special case of a general procedure for making small functions out of large ones. If / is a functi&n from Y to Z, say, and if X is a subset of Y, then there is a natural way of constructing a function g from X to Z; de fine g(x) to be equal to f(x) for each x in X. The function g is called the 32 Sec. 8 NAIVE SET THEORY restriction of / to X, and / is called an extension of g to Y ; it is customary to write g = / | X. The definition of restriction can be expressed by writing (/ 1 X)(x) = f(x) for each x in X; observe also that ran (/ 1X) = /(X). The inclusion map of a subset of Y is the restriction to that subset of the identity map on Y. Here is a simple but useful example of a function. Consider any two sets X and Y, and define a function / from X X Y onto X by writing y) = x. (The purist will have noted that we should have written f((x, y)) instead off(x, y), but nobody ever does.) The function/ is called the projection from X X Y onto X; if, similarly, g(x, y) = y, then g is the projection from X X Y onto Y. The terminology here is at variance with an earlier one, but not too badly.
