ince {x} e (a, b) and {a} e (x, y), it follows that a, b, x, and y are all equal. If a ^ b, then both (a, b) and (x, y) contain exactly one single ton, namely {a} and {x} respectively, so that a = x. Since in this case it is also true that both (a, b) and (x, y) contain exactly one unordered pair that is not a singleton, namely {a, b) and {x, y] respectively, it follows that \a,b] = {x,y\, and therefore, in particular, be {x, y}. Since b cannot be x (for then we should have a = x and b = x, and, therefore, a = b), we must have b — y, and the proof is complete. If A and B are sets, does there exist a set that contains all the ordered pairs (a, b) with a in A and b in B. It is quite easy to see that the answer is yes. Indeed, if a e A and b e B, then {a} C A and {b} CZ B, and there fore {a, 6} CZ A U B. Since also {a} <Z A U B, it follows that both {a} 24 Sec. 6 NAIVE SET THEORY and {a,b} are elements of <P(A U B). This implies that { {a}, {a, 6} } is a subset of (P(A U B), and hence that it is an element of (P((P( A U 5)) ; in other words (a, 6) « (P((P(4 U B)) whenever a e A and b « B. Once this is known, it is a routine matter to apply the axiom of specification and the axiom of extension to produce the unique set A X B that consists exactly of the ordered pairs (a, b) with a in A and b in B. This set is called the Cartesian product of A and B ; it is characterized by the fact that A X B = {x: a; = (a, 6) /or sotoe a in A and for some b in B}. The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs (that is, a set each of whose elements is an ordered pair), and the same is true of every subset of a Cartesian product. It is of technical importance to know that we can go in the converse direction also : every set of ordered pairs is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. In other words: if R is a set such that every element of R is an ordered pair, then there exist two sets A and B such that R C A X B. The proof is elementary. Suppose indeed that x eR, so that x = {{a}, {a, 6} } for some a and for some 6. The problem is to dig out a and b from under the braces. Since the elements of R are sets, we can form the union of the sets in R ; since x is one of the sets in R, the elements of x belong to that union. Since [a, b\ is one of the elements of x, we may write, in what has been called the brutal notation above, {a, b] e\J R. One set of braces has disappeared; let us do the same thing again to make the other set go away. Form the union of the sets in (J R. Since {a, b} is one of those sets, it follows that the elements of {a, 6} belong to that union, and hence both a and b belong to U U R. This fulfills the promise made above; to exhibit R as a subset of some A X B, we may take both A and B to be JJ \J R. It is often desirable to take A and B as small as possible. To do so, just apply the axiom of specification to produce the sets A = {a: for some b ((a, b) eR)} and B = {6: for some a ((a, 6) eR)}. These sets are called the projections of R onto the first and second coordi nates respectively. However important set theory may be now, when it began some scholars considered it a disease from which, it was to be hoped, mathematics would soon recover. For this reason many set-theoretic considerations were called pathological, and the word lives on in mathematical usage; it often refers to something the speaker does not like. The explicit definition of an Sec. 6 25 ORDERED PAIRS ordered pair ((a, b) = { {a}, {a, b] }) is frequently relegated to pathological set theory. For the benefit of those who think that in this case the name is deserved, we note that the definition has served its purpose by now and will never be used again. We need to know that ordered pairs are deter mined by and uniquely determine their first and second coordinates, that Cartesian products can be formed, and that every set of ordered pairs is a subset of some Cartesian product; which particular approach is used to achieve these ends is immaterial.
