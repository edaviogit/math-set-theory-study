s of X, then /(U<A,) = U,/C^,) (proof?), but the corresponding equation for intersections is false in gen eral (example?), and the connection between images and complements is equally unsatisfactory. A correspondence between the elements of X and the elements of Y does always induce a well-behaved correspondence between the subsets of X and the subsets of Y, not forward, by the formation of images, but backward, by the formation of inverse images. Given a function / from X to Y, let J~1, the inverse of /, be the function from <P( Y) to <P{X) such that if B C Y, then S-\B) = /(*).*}. In words: f-1(B) consists of exactly those elements of X that / maps into B; the set/-1(B) is called the inverse image of B under/. A necessary and sufficient condition that / map X onto Y is that the inverse image under / of each non-empty subset of Y be a non-empty subset of X. (Proof?) A necessary and sufficient condition that / be one-to-one is that the inverse image under / of each singleton in the range of / be a singleton in X. If the last condition is satisfied, then the symbol /_1 is frequently as signed a second interpretation, namely as the function whose domain is the range of /, and whose value for each y in the range of / is the unique r in X for which j{x) = y. In other words, for one-to-one functions / we may write /-1(j/) = x if and only if f(x) = y. This use of the notation is SEC. 10 INVERSES AND COMPOSITES 39 mildly inconsistent with our first interpretation of f*, but the double meaning is not likely to lead to any confusion. The connection between images and inverse images is worth a moment's consideration. If B c Y, then f(f-"(B)) c B. Proof. If y eff"(B)), then y = f(z) for some 2 in f '(B); this means that g = f(z) and f(a) e B, and therefore ye B. If f maps X onto Y, then f(f-*(B)) = B. Proof. If ye B, then y = f(x) for some a in X, and therefore for some z in f"(B); this means that ye f(f"(B)). If A c X, then - A cf. "(f(A)). Proof. If a e A, then f(x) ef(A); this means that z ef"(f(A)). If f is one-to-one, then A = f^*(f(A)). Proof. If a e f"(f(A)), then f(x) e f(A), and therefore f(x) = f(u) for some u in A; this implies that z = u and hence that a e A. The algebraic behavior off" is unexceptionable. If {B,} is a family of subsets of Y, then - fT" (U; B) = U; f"(B.) f"(ſ), B;) = ſh;f-*(B). The proofs are straightforward. If, for instance, a ef"(ſ), B.), then f(x) e B; for all i, so that a ef"(B) for all i, and therefore a e ſh; f"(B); all the steps in this argument are reversible. The formation of inverse images commutes with complementation also; i.e., f"(Y – B) = X – f'(B) for each subset B of Y. Indeed: if a e f"(Y – B), then f(x) e Y — B, so that a e"f "(B), and therefore a e X– f'(B); the steps are reversible. (Observe that the last equation is indeed a kind of commutative law: it says that complementation followed by inversion is the same as inversion followed by complementation.) The discussion of inverses shows that what a function does ean in a cer and 40 Sec. 10 NAIVE SET THEORY tain sense be undone; the next thing we shall see is that what two functions do can sometimes be done in one step. If, to be explicit, / is a function from X to Y and g is a function from Y to Z, then every element in the range of / belongs to the domain of g, and, consequently, g(f(x)) makes sense for each x in X. The function h from X to Z, defined by h(x) = g(f(x)) is called the composite of the functions / and g; it is denoted by g "f or, more simply, by gf. (Since we shall not have occasion to consider any other kind of multiplication for functions, in this book we shall use the latter, simpler notation only.) Observe that the order of events is important in the theory of functional composition. In order that gf be defined, the range of / must be included in the domain of g, and this can happen without it necessarily happening in the other direction at the same time.
