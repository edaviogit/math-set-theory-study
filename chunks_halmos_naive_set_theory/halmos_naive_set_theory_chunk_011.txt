fference between A and B, more often known as the relative complement of B in A, is the set A — B defined by A - B = {xeA-.xe'B}. Note that in this definition it is not necessary to assume that Be A. In order to record the basic facts about complementation as simply as possi ble,- we assume nevertheless (in this section only) that all the sets to be mentioned are subsets of one and the same set E and that all complements (unless otherwise specified) are formed relative to that E. In such situa tions (and they are quite common) it is easier to remember the underlying set E than to keep writing it down, and this makes it possible to simplify the notation. An often used symbol for the temporarily absolute (as op posed to relative) complement of A is A'. In terms of this symbol the basic facts about complementation can be stated as follows: (A')' = A, 0' = E, W-0, AH A' = 0, AU A' = *?, AcBij and only if B' c A'. The most important statements about complements are the so-called Be Morgan laws: (A U B)' = A' D B', (A 0 B)' = A' U B'. (We shall see presently that the De Morgan laws hold for the unions and intersections of larger collections of sets than just pairs.) These facts about 17 18 Sec. 5 NAIVE SET THEORY complementation imply that the theorems of set theory usually come in pairs. If in an inclusion or equation involving unions, intersections, and complements of subsets of E we replace each set by its complement, inter change unions and intersections, and reverse all inclusions, the result is ai other theorem. This fact is sometimes referred to as the principle of di ality for sets. Here are some easy exercises on complementation. A - fl = A fl fl'. A C B if and only if A — B = 0. \^ A - (A - B) = A n B. a n (b - c) = (A n b) - (A n c). a n b c (a n o u (5 n c% (A U C) D (B U C) C A U fl. If A and fl are sets, the symmetric difference (or Boolean sum) of A and B is the set A + B defined by A + B = (A - fl) U (fl - A). This operation is commutative (A + B = fl + A) and associative (A + (fl + C) = (A + B) + C), and is such that A + 0 = Aand4 + 4 = 0- This may be the right time to straighten out a trivial but occasionally puzzling part of the theory of intersections. Recall, to begin with, that intersections were denned for non-empty collections only. The reason is that the same approach to the empty collection does not define a set. Which x's are specified by the sentence x eX for every X in 0. As usual for questions about 0 the answer is easier to see for the corre sponding negative question. Which x's do not satisfy the stated condition. If it is not true that x e X for every X in. 0, then there must exist an X in 0 such that x e' X; since, however, there do not exist any X'a in 0 at all, this is absurd. Conclusion: no x fails to satisfy the stated condition, or, equivalently, every x does satisfy it. In other words, the x's that the con dition specifies exhaust the (nonexistent) universe. There is no profound problem here; it is merely a nuisance to be forced always to be making Sec. 5 19 COMPLEMENTS AND POWERS qualifications and exceptions just because some set somewhere along some construction might turn out to be empty. There is nothing to be done about this; it is just a fact of life. If we restrict our attention to subsets of a particular set E, as we have temporarily agreed to do, then the unpleasantness described in the pre ceding paragraph appears to go away. The point is that in that case we can define the intersection of a collection e (of subsets of E) to be the set {x e E: x e X for every X in Q}. This is nothing revolutionary; for each non-empty collection, the new def inition agrees with the old one. The difference is in the way the old and the new definitions treat the empty collection; according to the new define tion C\x*0 X is equal to E. (For which elements x of E can it be false that x e X for every X in 0?) The difference is just a matter of language.
