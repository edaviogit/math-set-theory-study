y definition, a special kind of well ordered set; we proceed to examine its special properties. The most elementary fact is that each element of an ordinal number a is at the same time a subset of a. (In other words, every ordinal number is a transitive set.) Indeed, if £ « a, then the fact that s(£) = £ implies that each element of £ is a predecessor of £ in a and hence, in particular, an element of a. If £ is an element of an ordinal number a, then, as we have just seen, £ is a subset of a, and, consequently, £ is a well ordered set (with respect to the ordering it inherits from a). Assertion: £ is in fact an ordinal number. Indeed, if rj e £, then the initial segment determined by jj in £ is the same as the initial segment determined by jj in a; since the latter is equal to ri, so is the former. Another way of formulating the same result is to say that every initial segment of an ordinal number is an ordinal number. The next thing to note is that if two ordinal numbers are similar, then they are equal. To prove this, suppose that a and 0 are ordinal numbers and that / is a similarity from a onto /3; we shall show that /(£) = £ for each £ in a. The proof is a straightforward transfinite induction. Write S = {£ e <*:/(£) = £}. For each £ in a, the least element of a that does not belong to s(£) is £ itself. Since / is a similarity, it follows that the least ele ment of /3 that does not belong to the image of s(£) under/ is/(£). These assertions imply that if s(£) c S, then/(£) and £ are ordinal numbers with the same initial segments, and hence that/(£) = £. We have proved thus that £ e S whenever s(£) c <S. The principle of transfinite induction implies that S = a, and from this it follows that a = /3. If a and f) are ordinal numbers, then, in particular, they are well ordered sets, and, consequently, either they are similar or else one of them is simi 78 Sec. 20 79 SETS OF ORDINAL NUMBERS lar to an initial segment of the other. If, say, /8 is similar to an initial seg ment of a, then /3 is similar to an element of a. Since every element of a is an ordinal number, it follows that /3 is an element of a, or, in still other words, that a is a continuation of /3. We know by now that if a and /3 are distinct ordinal numbers, then the statements Pea, a is a continuation of /3, are all equivalent to one another; if they hold, we may write /3 < a. What we have just proved is that any two ordinal numbers are comparable; that is, if a and 0 are ordinal numbers, then either 0 = a, or (3 < a, or a < 0. The result of the preceding paragraph can be expressed by saying that every set of ordinal numbers is totally ordered. In fact more is true: every set of ordinal numbers is well ordered. Suppose indeed that E is a non empty set of ordinal numbers, and let a be an element of E. If a ^ /. for all /3 in E, then a is the first element of E and all is well. If this is not the case, then there exists an element 0 in E such that /3 < a, i.e., /3 e a; in other words, then a fl E is not empty. Since a is a well ordered set, a H E has a first element, say oq. If /3 « E, then either a ^ (in which case a0 < /3), or 0 < a (in which case /3 e a fl E and therefore «o ^ /3), and this proves that E has a first element, namely oq. Some ordinal numbers are finite; they are just the natural numbers (i.e., the elements of w). The others are called transfinite; the set w of all natural numbers is the smallest transfinite ordinal number. Each finite ordinal number (other than 0) has an immediate predecessor. If a transfinite or dinal number a has an immediate predecessor /3, then, just as for natural numbers, a = /3+. Not every transfinite ordinal number does have an immediate predecessor; the ones that do not are called limit numbers. Suppose now that Q is a collection of ordinal numbers.
