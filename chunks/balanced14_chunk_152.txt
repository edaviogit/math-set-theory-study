Theorem 7.2.2. Let P be the Fin×Fin poset.
1. For every ultrafilter W on the set ω ×ω∗ containing no set n×ω∗ for
n∈ω, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(ω×ω∗)),τ (cid:105) is balanced in P;
W
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) there is an ultrafilter W on the set ω×ω∗,
containing no set n×ω∗ for n ∈ ω, such that the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105)
and (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(ω×ω∗)),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
W
3. distinct ultrafilters give rise to inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Proof. Towards (1), suppose that V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic exten-

To this end, use Proposition 7.0.2 for the sets a ,a and the ultrafilter W

to see that a ∩a is infinite. This means, that the set b={n∈ω: ∃U (cid:104)n,U(cid:105)∈

(p ) diagonalize the same ultrafilter U on ω for which (cid:104)n,U(cid:105) ∈ a ∩a holds.
