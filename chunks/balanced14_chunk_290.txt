Let Q be a poset and let σ be a Q-name for a condition in the set A. Let
V[G] be a generic extension such that P(Q)∩V is countable in V[G] and H is
a perfect set of filters on Q in finite tuples mutually generic over V. We must
find a condition r ∈P in the model V[G] such that the set {H ∈H: r ≤σ/H}

Definition 12.2.1. LetP beaSuslinposet. Avirtualconditionp¯isBernstein
balanced if in every generic extension V[G], for every condition p ≤ p¯, every
infiniteposetQ∈V suchthatP(Q)∩V iscountableinV[G],andeveryperfect
family H ⊂ P(Q) such that each finite set a ⊂ H is a collection of filters
mutually generic over V, there is a filter H ∈ H such that every condition in
P ∩V[H] below p¯is compatible with p. The poset P is Bernstein balanced if
there is a Bernstein balanced virtual condition below every condition in P.

balanced. To see this, note that any condition p≤p¯in any extension V[G] has
countable domain. On the other hand, if H ∈ V[G] is a perfect set of filters
mutually generic over V, then by the product forcing theorem, for each point
x ∈ dom(p)\V there is at most one filter H ∈ H such that x ∈ V[H]. By a
countingargumentthen,thereisafilterH ∈Hsuchthatdom(p)∩V[H]\V =0
and then p is compatible with every condition in V[H] which is stronger than
p¯.
