y = h(τ/G), y = h(σ/H), write γ ∈ Γ for the generic point associated with

the filter K, and let y = γ ·y . By the assumptions, y ,y , and y ∈ Y are

mutually orbit-equivalent points.

72 CHAPTER 2. THE VIRTUAL REALM
Claim 2.7.5. The point y ∈Y is generic over the model M, and in the model
2
M[y ] there exists a point x∈X such that M[y ]|=Q(cid:13)τ E xˇ.
2 2
Proof. There is a point δ ∈Γ in the model V[G][H] such that y =δ·y . The
1 0
point γ ∈ Γ is P -generic over V[G][H] by the product forcing theorem. Now,
Γ
multiplication by δ from the right is an automorphism of the poset P , so the
Γ
point γδ ∈ Γ is P -generic over V[G][H]. Therefore, the point γδ is also P -
Γ Γ
generic over the smaller model M[G], and by the product forcing theorem, G
and γδ are mutually generic objects over M. The point y =γδ·y ∈M[G,γδ]
2 0
belongs to a generic extension of M, so is generic over M itself.
Now, the model M[y ] is transitive, so by Mostowski absoluteness it must
2
contain a point x∈X such that h(x)F y , since one such point σ/H exists in
2
the model V[H][K]. We claim that M[y ] |= Q (cid:13) τ E xˇ. To see this, observe

thatthefilterG⊂QisgenericoverthemodelV[H][K],soalsogenericoverthe
smaller model M[y ]. Since M[G][y ]|=y =h(τ/G)F y , the forcing theorem
2 2 0 2
implies that M[y ]|=Q(cid:13)h(τ)F yˇ , so τ E xˇ.

Bythesecondparagraphoftheproof,itmustbethecasethatM[y ]|=|κ|=

ℵ ; therefore, V[H][K] |= |κ| = ℵ . This, however, contradicts the assumption

that in V, |R|<κ, which is equivalent to |R×P |<κ.

2.8 Dichotomies
This section presents three theorems which characterize various complex fea-
tures of the virtual realm in terms of dichotomies. It turns out that each of
the dichotomies uses a preparatory proposition or two on the descriptive the-
ory of forcing and model theory. These preparatory propositions are perhaps
more difficult to state properly than to prove. Nevertheless, they are unavoid-
ably needed and they do not seem to be present in published literature. We
gather them in the first subsection, while the second subsection contains the
dichotomies themselves.
2.8a Preliminaries
The first two auxiliary propositions concern pure model theory; they show that
the satisfaction relation and the construction of models from indiscernibles are
in a suitable sense Borel affairs. The proofs are straightforward and left to the
reader. For both of them, fix a countable language and let X be the Polish
space of models of that language whose universe is ω.
Proposition2.8.1. Supposethatf: 2ω →X isaBorelfunction,φisaformula
of the language with n free variables, and g : 2ω → ω are Borel functions for
i
every i∈n. The set {x∈X: f(x)|=φ(g (x),g (x)...g (x))} is Borel.
