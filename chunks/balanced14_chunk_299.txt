Example 12.2.18. Let P be the balanced poset of Example 8.8.4. In the P-
extensionoftheSolovaymodelthereisadominatingsubsetofωω suchthatthe
set of all functions in in dominated by any fixed y ∈ωω is countable. Thus, the
conclusion of the theorem fails in the P-extension with the P-ideal I on ω×ω
consisting of sets with all vertical sections finite. The poset P is not Bernstein
balanced.
We conclude this section with an anti-preservation result and an example justi-
fying the choice of the Berstein name for the class of posets in question. Recall
that a Bernstein set is a subset of a Polish space such that neither it nor its
complement contain a perfect set.
Proposition 12.2.19. In nontrivial, cofinally Bernstein balanced extensions of
the symmetric Solovay model, there is a Bernstein set.
Proof. SupposethatκisaninaccessiblecardinalandP isaSuslinpartialorder
whichisBernsteinbalancedcofinallybelowκ. LetW bethesymmetricSolovay
model derived from κ and work in the model W. Let p ∈ P be a condition.
Let V[K] be an intermediate extension obtained with a poset of size < κ such
that p ∈ V[K] and P is Bernstein balanced in V[K]. Working in V[K], find a
Bernstein balanced condition p¯≤p, and a poset Q of size <κ and a Q-name σ
for a condition such that Q (cid:13) σ ≤ p¯. Since the poset P contains no atoms, it
is also possible to find Q-names σ ,σ for incompatible elements of P stronger

than σ.
Back in W, let {H : y ∈2ω} be a perfect collection of filters on Q pairwise
y
generic over the model V[K], obtained by an application of Proposition 1.7.10.
Let τ be the P-name for the set {y ∈ 2ω: σ /H belongs to the generic fil-
0 0 y
ter on P} and let τ be the P-name for the set {y ∈ 2ω: σ /H belongs to
1 1 y
the generic filter on P}. These are clearly forced to be disjoint subsets of 2ω,
and p¯ forces that complement of neither contains a perfect set: any condi-
tion below p¯ is incompatible with only countably many conditions in the set
{σ /H ,σ /H : y ∈ 2ω} by the Bernstein balance of the virtual condition p¯.

Thus, p¯forces both τ ,τ to be Bernstein sets.
