9.3. THE TURBULENT DIVIDE 213
Solovay model derived from κ and work in the model W. Suppose towards
a contradiction that there is a condition p ∈ P and a P-name for a function
which is an injection from the E-quotient space to the F-quotient space. The
condition p as well as the name τ must be definable from some ground model
parameters together with a parameter z ∈ 2ω. Use the assumptions to find an
intermediate model V[K], which is obtained from V by a poset of cardinality
smaller than κ, contains z and in which the poset P is placid.
Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a virtual condition in P which is
weakly placid. Let P be the poset for adding a Cohen point of the space X.

σ for an element of the poset P stronger than p¯and η for an element of Y such
that P ×R(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13) τ([x˙] )=[η] . There are two cases.

Case 1. There is a nonempty open set O ⊂ X and a condition r ∈ R such
that the name η is F-pinned below (cid:104)O,r(cid:105). In this case, let x ,x ∈ X and

Case 2. Case 1 fails. This is to say that η is forced not to be a realization of
any F-pinned class of V[K]. Let P be the Cohen poset on the Polish group Γ

Since the action of the group is a continuous open map from Γ × X to

By their initial choice, the points x ,x ∈ X are E-related. By the virtual

placidity assumption on the equivalence relation F, the points y ,y ∈ Y are

not F-related: if they were, they would be realizations of some virtual F-class

forcing theorem applied in V[K] shows that in the model W, the lower bound
of p ,p forces in P that τ([x ] ) must be equal simultaneously to [y ] and
