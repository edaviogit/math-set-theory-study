space. The 3-Hamel hypergraph is the set Γ ⊂ [X]3 consisting of triples of
linearly dependent nonzero elements of X. A Γ-coloring c: X →ω is called an
3-Hamel decomposition.
Proposition 8.1.10. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ.
Then there is a 3-Hamel decomposition of X.
Proof. Let A⊂X be a Hamel basis. Let B a countable basis of the topology of
the ambient Polish space of which X is a Borel subset. We define a Γ-coloring
whose range is the countable set C = (Φ×B)<ω. For each nonzero element
x ∈X, let x =Σ φ y be the unique expression of x as a linear combination
i∈n i i
of basis vectors with nonzero coefficients, in which the basis vectors are listed
in an increasing order with respect to some fixed Borel linear ordering of X.
Let (cid:104)O : i ∈ n(cid:105) be the first sequence (in some fixed enumeration) of pairwise
i
disjoint basic open sets in the basis B such that y ∈ O holds for every i ∈ n.
i i
Define the coloring c: X → C by setting c(0) = 0 and c(x) = (cid:104)φ ,O : i ∈ n(cid:105)
i i
where φ ,O are as above.

We must show that there is no monochromatic Γ-edge. Suppose towards a
contradiction that x0,x1,x2 ∈ X are distinct nonzero elements of X, all with
the same color (cid:104)φ ,O : i ∈ n(cid:105), such that some nontrivial linear combination of
i i
them yields zero. Let y0 ∈ O be the basis vectors yielding x0, similarly for y1
i i i
and y2. Since the three vectors are distinct, there must be i∈n and j ∈3 such
i
that yj is distinct from yk for all k ∈ 3 different from j. But then, the basis
i i
vector yj can be expressed as a linear combination of all the remaining basis
i
vectors used to obtain the points x0,x1,x2. Since the remaining vectors are all
distinct from yj, this is a contradiction.

We now provide a balanced forcing which adds a 3-Hamel coloring to a given
Borel vector space over a countable field.

Γ is the 3-Hamel hypergraph. The ordering is defined by q ≤p if p⊂q, and for

It is not difficult to see that P is a σ-closed Suslin poset. We now classify its
balanced conditions.

Γ be the 3-Hamel hypergraph and let P be the 3-Hamel decomposition forcing.
1. If c: X →ω is a Γ-coloring, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105) is balanced;
2. if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair, then there is a Γ-coloring c: X →ω such that
the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct Γ-colorings yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
