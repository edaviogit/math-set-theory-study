uch that p (cid:13) τ ⊂ X is an E-invariant set
containing uncountably many E-classes. The condition p as well as the name τ
have to be definable from parameters in V as well as some parameter z ∈ 2ω.

12.1. PERFECTLY BALANCED FORCING 301
Use the assumptions to find an intermediate model V[K] obtained as a generic
extension of V by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ such that z ∈V[K] and
P is perfectly balanced in V[K].

while the set τ is forced to contain uncountably many E-classes. It follows that
in the model V[K] there has to be a poset R of cardinality smaller than κ, an

Use Proposition 1.7.10 to find a perfect set H of filters on R which are in finite
tuples mutually generic over V[K]. Note that by the mutual genericity and
the initial choice of the name η, the points η/H for H ∈ H are pairwise E-
unrelated. By the perfect balance of the virtual condition p¯, there is a perfect
set C ⊂ H such that the set {σ/H: H ∈ C} has a lower bound, say q ∈ P in
the separative quotient of P. By the forcing theorem applied in every model
V[K][H] for H ∈ C it is the case that in the model W, the condition q forces
the perfect set {η/H: H ∈ C} consisting of pairwise E-unrelated elements to
be a subset of τ. The proof is complete.
The second preservation theorem of this section deals with a strong form of the
well-known Open Coloring Axiom, OCA [91].
Definition 12.1.7. OCA+isthefollowingstatement. WheneverX isaPolish
space, A ⊂ X is a set, and Γ is a graph on A which is open in the topology
on A×A inherited from X ×X, then either A is a union of countably many
Γ-anticliques, or A contains a perfect Γ-clique.
The following result is stated using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 12.1.8. In every cofinally perfectly balanced extension of the sym-
metric Solovay model, OCA+ holds.
Proof. Let X be a Polish space and let P be a perfect Suslin forcing. Let κ be
an inaccessible cardinal such that in V , in every forcing extension the poset P
κ
isbalanced. LetW beasymmetricSolovaymodelderivedfromκ. Inthemodel
W, let Γ ⊂ X2 be a symmetric open set, let p ∈ P be a condition, and let τ
be a P-name for a subset of X such that p(cid:13)τ cannot be covered by countably
manyΓ-anticliques. WemustfindaperfectsetB ⊂X suchthatanytwopoints
of B are Γ-related, and a condition q ≤p in P which forces Bˇ ⊂τ.
To this end, choose a parameter z ∈ 2ω such that p,τ,Γ are definable from
z. Find an intermediate generic extension V[K] of V by a poset of cardinality
smaller than κ such that z ∈V[K] and P is perfectly balanced in V[K]. Work
in the model V[K]. Let p¯≤ p be a perfectly balanced virtual condition in P.
