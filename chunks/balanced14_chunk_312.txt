P is n+1,n-balanced in V[K]. Work in the model V[K].
Let p¯≤p be a n+1,n-balanced condition. Consider the poset P adding a

Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that q ∈P forces the opposite. Then,
Γ
q forces that in the Coll(ω,< κ)-extension there is a unique point δ ∈ ∆ such
that there is a condition p(cid:48) ≤ p¯in the poset P forcing τ(γ˙ ) = δ. Since the

Γ: γ is P -generic over V[K] and γ ∈q} and the function f: B →∆ assigning

to each point γ ∈B the point δ˙/γ. The function f is continuous on B, and the
choice of the name δ˙ implies that p¯(cid:13)fˇ⊂τ holds. The set B ⊂Γ is dense G

in q. A standard result in the theory of Polish groups [55, Theorems 9.9 and
9.10] now says that a homomorphism from Γ to ∆ which is continuous on a set
comeager in a nonempty open set is in fact continuous on the whole group Γ.
This contradicts the initial choice of the name τ.
Let X = {x ∈ Γn+1: (cid:81) x(i) = x(n)}; this is a closed subset of Γn+1,
i∈n
equipped with the topology inherited from Γn+1. If a ⊂ n+1 is a set of size
n, it is clear that the remaining coordinate of a point x ∈ X is a continuous
function of the coordinates x(i) for i ∈ a, and therefore the projection from X
to Γa is a continuous and open surjection. Let x ∈ X be a point P generic
X
over V[K]. Use Proposition 3.1.1 to see that whenever a ⊂ n+1 are distinct
numbers then x(cid:22)a∈Γ is a sequence (P )n-generic over V[K].
