However, since (cid:83) J ⊂ ω is cofinite, it has to be the case that q (cid:13) Jˇ = τ,
contradicting the initial assumptions on the name τ.
Let U be a nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω disjoint from I. There must be a
poset R of size < κ, an R-name η for an infinite subset of ω which is modulo
finite included in all sets in U, an R-name χ for a subset of ω and an R-
name σ for an element of P stronger than p¯ such that R (cid:13) χ∩η is infinite
and R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) χ ∈ τ. This occurs since τ is forced to be
P
a maximal almost disjoint family and therefore must contain an element with
infinite intersection with η.
Now, let H ,H ⊂ R be filters mutually generic over the model V[K]. Let

a = χ/H ,a = χ/H ∈ P(ω), and p = σ/H ,p = σ/H ∈ P. By the

Theorem 8.9.7 above produces a weakly balanced MAD forcing such that in its
extension of the Solovay model, a maximal almost disjoint family exists. As a
result of that example and Theorem 9.1.6, we have
Corollary 14.1.3. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that
ZF+DC holds, there is an infinite maximal almost disjoint family of subsets
of ω, and there is no uncountable sequence of pairwise distinct reals.
