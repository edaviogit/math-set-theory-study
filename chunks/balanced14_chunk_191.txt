some generic extension, filters H ⊂ R and H ⊂ R separately generic over

the ground model such that the conditions σ /H and σ /H are compatible in

P. The following claim is key.
Claim 8.9.8. For every i ∈ 2, the following holds. Whenever r ∈ R is a
i
condition and η for j ∈ω are names for elements of a \a , there is a number
j σi p
(cid:83)
n∈ω such that for every m∈ω there is a strengthening of r forcing η ∩
j∈m j
[n,m)=0.
Proof. For definiteness let i = 0. Suppose towards a contradiction that the
claim fails for a condition r ∈ R and names η for j ∈ m. Then, there is a

This shows that r (cid:13)σ (cid:54)≤(cid:104)a ,b(cid:105), contradicting the initial assumptions.

Let V[K] be a generic extension collapsing a sufficiently large cardinal and
work in V[K]. An inductive application of the claim makes it possible to find
filters H ⊂ R and H ⊂ R separately generic over the ground model, and a

partition ω = c of ω into finite sets such that, writing σ /H =(cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) and

σ /H =(cid:104)a ,b (cid:105), we have:

• for every infinite collection s ∈ V[H ] of pairwise disjoint subsets of ω,

there is e ∈ s which is a subset of some c for j even, and similarly for

We claim that the filters work as required. This is clearly the same as showing
that the pair (cid:104)a ∪a ,b ∪b (cid:105) belongs to P, since then it is a lower bound of
0 1 0 1
both (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) and (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105). First of all, the first item above immediately shows
0 0 1 1
that a ∪a is an almost disjoint family. To confirm the “moreover” demand
0 1
in the definition of the poset P for the pair (cid:104)a ∪ a ,b ∪ b (cid:105), suppose that
0 1 0 1
(cid:104)s,a(cid:105)∈b ∪b ; for definiteness assume that (cid:104)s,a(cid:105)∈b . Let d⊂(a ∪a )\a be
0 1 0 0 1
(cid:83)
a finite set; we must produce infinitely many e∈s such that d∩e=0.
Write d = d∩a and d = d\d . Since the pair (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) is a condition in
0 0 1 0 0 0
(cid:83)
the poset P, there are infinitely many sets e∈s such that d ∩e=0. By the
0
(cid:83)
second item above, there must be infinitely many e ∈ s such that d ∩e = 0
0
and e⊂c for some even number j ∈ω. By the first item above, there must be
j
(cid:83)
infinitely many sets e among them such that d ∩e=0. For all such e∈s, it
1
(cid:83)
is the case that d∩e=0. This completes the proof.
