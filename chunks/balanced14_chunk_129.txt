the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),Aˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct maximal K-sets yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.

Proof. For(1), supposethatV[H ],V[H ]aremutuallygenericextensionsofV
0 1
and p ∈ V[H ], p ∈ V[H ] are conditions extending A; we must show that
0 0 1 1
p ∪p is a K-set. Suppose towards a contradiction that a ⊂ p and a ⊂ p
0 1 0 0 1 1
are finite sets such that a ∪a ∈/ K. Choosing a ,a inclusion-minimal, we
0 1 0 1
conclude that {a ,a } ∈ Γ . Since the graph Γ is locally countable, by the
0 1 K K
Mostowski absoluteness between V[H ] and V[H ,H ] it must be the case that
0 0 1
as a ∈ V[H ], a ∈ V[H ] must hold as well. Thus, a ∈ V[H ]∩V[H ] = V.

Since A was a maximal K-set and A∪a ⊂p is a K-set, it follows that a ⊂A

and a ∪a ⊂p , contradicting the assumption that a ∪a ∈/ K.

For (2), let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair; strengthening τ if necessary we may
assumethatitisaQ-nameforasingleK-set. ReplacingQwithQ×Coll(ω,X)
and strengthening the condition τ if necessary, we may assume that Q (cid:13) ∀x ∈
XV x ∈ τ or there is a ⊂ τ such that {x}∪a ∈/ K. For each point x ∈ X,
either Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ or Q (cid:13) ∃a ⊂ τ ∈ Γ and a ⊂ τ by a balance argument. Let

A ⊂ X be the set of all points x ∈ X for which the first option prevails. Then

model and its Q-extension, it must be that Q (cid:13) a ⊂ V and then a ⊂ Aˇ. It
follows that A∪{x} is not a K-set as desired.
Finally, (3) is obvious. For the last sentence, any condition p ∈ P can
be extended to a maximal K-set, which then represents a balanced condition
stronger than p by (1).
Example 6.2.3. Let E be a countable Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. Let K be the set of all finite sets consisting of pairwise E-unrelated
elements. Then Γ consists of all edges {{x },{x }} where x ,x ∈ X are
K 0 1 0 1
distinct E-related points, so K is locally countable. The balanced pairs are
classified by maximal K-sets, which are precisely the E-transversals.
For the following example, recall the notion of a perfect matching of a graph;
this is just a set of edges such that each vertex gets exactly one edge in the set
adjacent to it. For a locally finite bipartite graph Γ, the existence of a perfect
matchingisequivalenttoHall’s marriage condition [38]: foreveryfinitesetaof
vertices on one side of the bipartition, the set of neighbors of a has cardinality
at least that of a.
Example 6.2.4. Let Γ be a locally finite bipartite Borel graph on a Polish
space X satisfying the Hall’s marriage condition; view Γ as a subset of [X]2.

given a finite set a⊂Γ, the membership of a in K can be detected by checking
all fragments of a in the components of Γ which are countable. The balanced
