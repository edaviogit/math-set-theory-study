orem 3.4.1. The following examples deal with equivalence relations associated
with ideals on countable sets. If a is a countable set and J is an ideal on a,
write = for the equivalence relation on the space X =(2ω)a connecting points

Proof. Write X = (2ω)2<ω. For every node t ∈ ω<ω write [t] for the set of all
nodesin2<ω extendingt. LetV[G ],V[G ]betwogenericextensionscontaining

model}. This is a subtree of ω<ω. If 0∈/ T then the proof is complete; thus, it
is only necessary to derive a contradiction from the assumption 0 ∈ T. First,
observe that the tree T cannot have any terminal nodes: if t were a terminal
node of T then one could combine the ground model witnesses for t(cid:97)0∈/ T and
t(cid:97)1 ∈/ T to find a witness for t ∈/ T. Second, observe that the definition of the
tree T depends only on the = -class of x , so T ∈ V[G ]∩V[G ] = V. Since

T is a nonempty ground model tree without endnodes, it must have an infinite
branch y ∈ 2ω in the ground model. Since x = x , there is a number n ∈ ω

such that for every t ∈ 2<ω such that x (t) (cid:54)= x (t), either t is incompatible

with y (cid:22)n or else t is an initial segment of y. Let e=[y (cid:22)n]\{y (cid:22)m: m≥n}
and observe that e ∈ V and x and x coincide on e, therefore x (cid:22) e ∈ V. If

A whole class of ideals with placid equivalence relations is isolated in the fol-
lowing definition.
Definition 3.4.5. AnidealI onω iscountably separated ifthereisacountable
collection A of subsets of ω such that for every b ∈ I and c ∈/ I there is a ∈ A
such that b∩a=0 and c∩a∈/ I.
Countably separated ideals include for example the ideal of nowhere dense sub-
sets of the rationals; a characterization theorem is proved in [62]. Note that if
I is analytic then the instrumental property of the set A is coanalytic, and by
Mostowski absoluteness it will hold in all forcing extensions.
