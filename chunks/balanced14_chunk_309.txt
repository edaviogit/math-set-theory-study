ordinal parameters; below, we will evaluate them in other models using these
definitions. We also evaluate P ,P using their definitions. Write (cid:13) for the

forcing relation of P and (cid:13) for the forcing relation of P .

Let H ⊂ Q be a generic filter. Let j: V → M be the associated generic
κ
ultrapower and work in the model M. Note that G ⊂j(G ) is a countable set
1 1
inthemodelM andbytheσ-closureassumptionontheposetP ,thefilterj(G )
1 1
must contain a lower bound of G . Consider the set B ={x∈X: ∃p∈P p is
1 1
alowerboundofthefilterG andp(cid:13) xˇ∈τ }. Clearly,thesetB ⊂X belongs
1 1 1
to L(R) and it contains the set j(A ). By the elementarity of the embedding j,

it will be enough to show that B is disjoint from the set j(A ).

To see this, we prove the following claim, which is also a statement of the
model M. Call a Borel set C ⊂X positive if for every condition p ∈P which
1 1
is a lower bound of the filter G , p (cid:13) C ∩τ (cid:54)= 0. By the forcing theorem
1 1 1 1
applied to j(G ), C∩A (cid:54)=0 holds for every positive Borel set C. Clearly, the
1 1
collection of positive Borel sets is in L(R).
Claim 12.4.13. Ifp ∈P isaconditionwhichisalowerboundofthefilterG

and x ∈ B is a point such that p (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ , then there is a condition p(cid:48) ≤ p

and a positive Borel set C ⊂X such that p(cid:48) (cid:13) C ⊂τ .

The theorem immediately follows. By the claim and the genericity of the filter
j(G )overL(R),theremustbeinj(G )eitheraconditionwhichforcesB∩τ =

0 or a condition which forces C ⊂ τ for some Borel positive set C ⊂ X.

However,thelatteralternativemeansthatj(A )∩j(A )(cid:54)=0,contradictingour

initial assumptions on A ,A . The former alternative confirms that the set B

separates j(A ) and j(A ) as required.

To prove the claim, fix p ∈P and x∈X as in the assumption. In view of
0 0
the fact that the reals of the model M are the reals of some symmetric Solovay
model derived from κ (Fact 1.7.18(3)), in the ground model there must be a
poset Q of size < κ and Q-names σ ,σ ,η for conditions in P ,P and a point

Moreover, there has to be a filter K ⊂ Q generic over V such that p = σ /K
0 0
andx=η/K. Now,letH ⊂Coll(ω,P(Q)∩V)beafilterinM mutuallygeneric
over V with the filter K.
Work in the model V[H]. Use Proposition 1.7.10 to find a continuous func-
tion y (cid:55)→ H which to each element y ∈ 2ω assigns a filter H ⊂ Q so that for
y y
everyfiniteseta⊂2ω, thefilters{H : y ∈a}aremutuallygenericoverV. For
y
every element y ∈2ω, write p =σ /K , p =σ /K , and x =η/K . Since
0y 0 y 1y 1 y y y
the conditions p ∈P are all stronger than the balanced virtual condition p¯
0y 0 0
and they are found in mutually generic models, each finite set of them has a
lower bound as in Claim 12.1.4. By the perfectness assumption on the poset
P , the model V[H] contains a perfect set D ⊂ 2ω and a condition r ∈ P
0 0
which is stronger than all p for all y ∈ D. Since both conditions p ,r ∈ P
0y 0 0
are stronger than the balanced virtual condition p¯ and are found in mutually

generic models, they are compatible with a lower bound p(cid:48).

many points y ∈ D. As a result, C ⊂ X is a positive Borel set. The initial
choice of the name η also implies that p(cid:48) (cid:13) C ⊂ τ . The claim has just been
