Theorem 14.5.1 provides many other corollaries, among which we quote the
following application of Example 10.5.8:
Corollary 14.5.5. Let E be a pinned Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X.

14.6. THE RAMSEY ULTRAFILTER EXTENSION 355
1. Let P be the linearization poset for E as in Example 8.6.5. In the P-
extension of the Solovay model, there is no tournament on the F -quotient

space;
2. it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
E-quotient space is linearly ordered, and yet there is no tournament on
the F -quotient space.

Proof. The linearization poset is certainly σ-closed. It is balanced by Exam-
ple 8.6.5 and ℵ -tethered by Example 10.5.8.

14.6 The Ramsey ultrafilter extension
Let P be the poset of infinite subsets of ω ordered by inclusion. Let κ be an
inaccessiblecardinal,andletW bethesymmetricSolovaymodelderivedfromκ.
Let U ⊂P be a filter generic over W. The model W[U] is a balanced extension
of W by Theorem 7.1.2. It is immediate that U is a nonprincipal ultrafilter
on ω and in fact a Ramsey ultrafilter. The model W[U] has been investigated
for decades ??? We have provided new information about the model at several
locationsinthisbook. Inthissection,weoutlineseveralmajorareasofstudyof
the model W[U] and gather the available known results as well as critical open
questions.
Question14.6.1. ClassifytheBorelequivalencerelationsE,F onPolishspaces
such that in W[U], |E| ≤ |F| holds. In particular, are there Borel equivalence
relations E,F such that |E|≤|F| fails in the symmetric Solovay model W and
holds in W[U]?
We have proved that in W[U], the smooth divide is preserved (Corollary 9.2.5,
the orbit divide is preserved (Corollary 9.4.8), and the E -divide is preserved

(Corollary 9.5.10. However, our efforts stalled in other directions. We do not

Question 14.6.2. Classify the Borel equivalence relations E such that the E-
quotient space is linearly ordered in W[U].
As a basic affirmative result in this direction, we show that E and E -quotient

spaces are linearly ordered in W[U]. To see this, observe in ZF+DC plus the
existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω that the class of linearly orderable
equivalencerelationsisclosedundercountableincreasingunions. Fortheproof,
let X be a Polish space and (cid:104)E : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be an increasing sequence of analytic

equivalence relations on X, each with linearly orderable quotient space. Use
the DC assumption to pick linear orders ≤ for each of them. Let U be a
n
nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω. If x,y ∈ X are E-unrelated elements, then let
