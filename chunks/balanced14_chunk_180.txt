an elementary substructure of q.

8.6. SATURATED MODELS ON QUOTIENT SPACES 189
It is immediate that the union of the structures in the generic filter is a count-
ably saturated model of the theory T on the E-quotient space. To classify the
balanced virtual conditions, we use the following definition.
Definition 8.6.8. A balanced theory is a complete consistent theory S in the
language of T plus a constant for each virtual E-class which contains T and
asserts than no elements other than the virtual E-class constants are algebraic
over those constants.
Suppose that S is a balanced theory. Let τ be the Coll(ω,(cid:105) )-name for the
S ω1
set of all countable models p ∈ P such that dom(p) contains the set p of
TE 0
realizations of all ground model virtual E-classes and p |= S. It is not difficult

Theorem 8.6.9. Let T be a complete first-order theory in countable language,
with infinite models. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.

2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a balanced theory S such that the
balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;

3. distinct balanced theories yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.

Proof. For (1), suppose that S is a balanced theory, V[H ],V[H ] are mutually

generic extensions of the ground model, and p ,p ∈P are conditions in the
0 1 TE
respective models in the set given by the name τ . We must show that there is
S
a model q ∈ P in which both models p ,p of T are elementary. Note that
TE 0 1
dom(p )∩dom(p ) is exactly the set of all realizations of ground model virtual

E-classes by the mutual genericity assumption. Use the algebraicity clause of
Definition 8.6.8 and a textbook amalgamation theorem [41, Theorem 5.3.5] to
conclude that in V[H ,H ] there is a countable model q of T and elementary

For (2), let (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) be a balanced pair. Strengthening the name σ and the
poset Q if necessary, we may assume that σ is in fact a name for a single
element of P as opposed to an analytic subset of P and that σ is forced

to contain the realization of every virtual E-class in the ground model. By a
balance argument, for every formula φ((cid:126)x) and every tuple(cid:126)c of virtual E-classes
of the same length as (cid:126)x, it must be the case that either Q (cid:13) σ |= φ((cid:126)c) or
Q(cid:13)σ |=¬φ((cid:126)c). Let S be the set of all formulas and tuples of virtual E-classes
