does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number, yet it has countable chro-
matic number in some compactly balanced extension of the Solovay model.

Example 11.7.11. The actionable assumption cannot be removed from the
assumptions of Theorem 11.7.2.
Proof. Let Γ be the free group on two generators γ,δ. It acts on the space 2Γ
by shift; that is, (β ·x)(α) = x(β−1α) holds for all β,α ∈ Γ and x ∈ 2Γ. Let
X ⊂2Γ be the dense G set on which the action is free. Let E be the Γ-orbit
δ 0
equivalence relation on X. Let E be the orbit equivalence relation induced by

equivalence relations. Let G be the hypergraph on X of arity three containing
triples {x ,x ,x } consisting of pairwise E -related points and containing two

E -related and two E -unrelated points.

To see how a compactly balanced poset can make the chromatic number of
G countable, consider the Cayley graph H on X: it connects points x ,x if
0 1
x = γ·x (the γ-edges of H) or x = δ·x (the δ-edges of H) or vice versa.

This is an acyclic 4-regular graph whose connectedness components are exactly
theE -classes. InZFC,everyacyclicgraphwithoutverticesofdegree0or1has

by component. The following claim shows the impact of such an orientation on
the hypergraph G:
Claim 11.7.12. (ZF) Suppose that the graph H has an orientation in which
every vertex has out-degree one. Then the chromatic number of G is countable.
Proof. Let H(cid:126) be the orientation. For each x ∈ X the color h(x) is the pair
(cid:104)b = b(x),k = k(x)(cid:105) such that k is the largest possible number such that H(cid:126)
contains an oriented path from x to δck·x for some c∈{−1,1}. If k =0 then
b = 0, otherwise b = c. If such k does not exist,then the color h(x) is ∞. We
claim that h is a G-coloring.
To see this, consider any two E -related points x ,x ∈ X. In the H-path
0 0 1
between x ,x no vertex gets an out-degree two, and that leaves only three
0 1
cases: either the whole path is oriented towards x , or towards x , or towards
0 1
some point in the middle. Now, if h(x )=h(x )=∞ then all three cases show
0 1
that all the edges on the path must be δ-edges and so h(x )E h(x ). If x ,x
0 1 1 0 1
are E -related, say x = δm·x for some m > 0, and h(x ) (cid:54)= ∞, then in the
1 0 1 0
first two cases k(x ) (cid:54)= k(x ) and in the third case b(x ) = 1 (cid:54)= −1 = b(x ).

It follows that no G-hyperedge can be monochromatic: the homogeneous color
cannot be ∞ on the account of the two E -unrelated points in the hyperedge,
1
and the homogeneous color cannot be different from ∞ on the account of the
two E -related points in the hyperedge.

Claim 11.7.13. The hypergraph G does not have Borel σ-bounded fractional
chromatic number.
