Borel modular function. For (1), suppose that
V[H ] and V[H ] are mutually generic extensions of the ground model, and

a ∈ V[H ] and a ∈ V[H ] are elements of K such that A∪a ,A∪a are

K-sets; we must show that a ∪a ∈ K. Suppose towards a contradiction that

this fails. Using the maximality of the set A, enlarge the sets a ,a so that

a ∩a =a ∩V =a ∩V. Themodularityofthefunctionf impliesthattheset

f(a )∩f(a )\f(a ∩a ) is nonempty, containing some element y ∈ Y. Since

y ∈V[H ]∩V[H ], the product forcing theorem implies that y ∈V.

Back in V, consider the set B ⊂ K, B = {b ∈ K: y ∈ f(b) and for no
proper subset c ⊂ b, y ∈ f(c)}. Apply Definition 6.4.2 to A,B. The first
option is impossible by the modularity of the function f. The second option
gives a set b ∈ K such that b ⊂ A and y ∈ f(b). Increasing the set b if
necessary, we may arrange that a ∩V ⊂ b. But then, y ∈ f(a )∩f(b) while

Inthethirdoptionofthetrichotomy,thereis(inV)acountablesetp⊂Asuch
that no element of B can be added to it. Let b ⊂ a be an inclusion-minimal

subset of a such that y ∈f(b). Then b∈B and p∪b is a K-set, contradicting
0
the choice of p. (1) has been proved.
For (2), assume that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair. Replacing Q with Q ×
Coll(ω,X) and strengthening τ if necessary, we may assume that τ is in fact a
name for an element of P , and Q (cid:13) ∀x ∈ X ∩V x ∈ τ or {x}∪τ is not a
K
K-set. By the balance, for each x ∈ X it has to be the case that Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ or
Q(cid:13){xˇ}∪τ is not a K-set; let A⊂X be the set of all points x∈X for which
the former alternative occurs. We will show that A⊂X is a strongly maximal
K-set. Then, (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is equivalent to (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),A(cid:105). Since Q (cid:13) τ ≤ A holds,
in view of (1) and Proposition 5.2.4 (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is equivalent to (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),A(cid:105) as
desired.
Now, it is clear that A is a K-set, since it is forced to be a subset of the
K-set τ. Suppose towards a contradiction that A⊂X is not strongly maximal,
as witnessed by some Borel set B ⊂K.
Claim 6.4.4. There is a poset R and an R-name b˙ such that R (cid:13) b˙ ∈ K and
Aˇ∪b is a K-set.
Proof. LetRbetheposetofallstationarysubsetsof[X]ℵ0 orderedbyinclusion.
Now, if G⊂R is a generic filter and j: V →M is the associated generic ultra-
power,thesetX∩V belongstoM anditiscountableinM,asitisrepresented
by the identity function. Thus, A = j(A)∩(X ∩M) is a countable subset of
j(A) in the model M, and by the failure of the third option in Definition 6.4.2
in V and elementarity of j, M |=∃b b∈B and A∪b is a K-set. Since M is an
ω-model of set theory, these two statements about b transfer without change to
the generic extension V[G].
The treatment now divides into two cases.
