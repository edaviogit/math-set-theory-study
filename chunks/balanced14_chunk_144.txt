6.6 Quotient variations
Many simplicial complex forcings are naturally connected with a Borel equiva-
lence relation.

Definition 6.6.1. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
ABorelsimplicialcomplexK onX isanE-quotient complex ifthemembership
of any finite set a⊂X in K depends only on [a] . The letter E is left out if E
E
is understood from the context or will be specified later.
In this section we identify two general schemas for defining useful quotient sim-
plicial complexes and their associated posets: collapse posets for quotient car-
dinals and uniformization posets for quotient spaces.

Clearly, K is an (E ×F)∪F-quotient complex. The associated poset P is

referred to as the E,F-collapse poset.

The balanced conditions are neatly classified by injections from the virtual E-
quotient space X∗∗ to the virtual F-quotient space Y∗∗. If g: X∗∗ →Y∗∗ is an
injection, let τ be the Coll(ω,(cid:105) )-name for the set of those elements p ∈ P
g ω1 K
such that for each pair (cid:104)c,d(cid:105) ∈ g, there is a pair (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) ∈ p such that x ∈ X is
a realization of the virtual E-class c and y ∈ Y is a realization of the virtual
F-class d. Moreover, if d is a virtual F-class not in the range of g, then p is
requiredtocontainanelementy ∈Y whichisarealizationofthevirtualF-class

Theorem 6.6.3. Let E,F be Borel equivalence relations on respective Polish
spaces X,Y. Let P be the E,F-collapse poset.
1. For every total injection g: X∗∗ → Y∗∗, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) is a
ω1 g
balanced P-pin;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a total injection g: X∗∗ →Y∗∗ such
the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) is equivalent to (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105);
ω1 g
3. distinct injections as in (1) yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
Proof. Write R = Coll(ω,(cid:105) ). For (1), the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) is clearly a

P-pin. For the balance, let V[H ],V[H ] be mutually generic extensions of the

τ /H =τ /H ; we must show that p ,p ∈P are compatible.

To see this, suppose for example that (cid:104)x ,y (cid:105) ∈ p , (cid:104)x ,y (cid:105) ∈ p , and x E

Similarly, if (cid:104)x ,y (cid:105) ∈ p and y ∈ p , we need to show that y F y fails.
