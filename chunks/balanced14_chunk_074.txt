2.8. DICHOTOMIES 73
Proposition 2.8.2. There are Borel functions f: Y → X and g: Y ×ω → ω
such that for each y ∈Y,
1. f(y) is a model of T;
2. the function g : ω →ω is an order-preserving map from the ordering y to
y
the ordering of f(y) and its range consists of indiscernibles with theory S;
3. the model f(y) is a Skolem hull of rng(g ).

The rest of the subsection deals with models of set theory, showing that
the construction of their generic extensions is a Borel affair. Thus, let X be
the Polish space of all models for the language with one binary relation whose
universeisω. LetY beanyuncountablePolishspace,servingasanindexspace.
Let M: Y → X and P: Y → ω be Borel functions such that for each y ∈ Y,
M(y) is a model of (a large fragment of) ZF and M(y) |= P(y) is a partially
ordered set.
Proposition 2.8.3. There is a Borel function G: Y → P(ω) such that for
every y ∈Y, G(y) is a filter on P(y) which is generic over M(y).
Proof. By induction on n∈ω define Borel functions f : Y →ω so that
n
• for every y ∈Y, M(y)|=f (y) is the largest element of the poset P(y);
0
• for every y ∈ Y and n ∈ ω, if M(y) |= n is an open dense subset of the
poset P(y), then f (y) is the smallest number m such that M(y)|=m

The functions defined in this way are Borel by Proposition 2.8.1. Define the
function G: Y → P(ω) as follows: for every y ∈ ω, G(y) is the set of all m
such that M(y) |= m is an element of the poset P(y) and for some n ∈ ω,
M(y)|=f (y) is smaller than m in the poset P(y). It is clear that the function
n
G works.
Now, suppose that a Borel function G: Y → P(ω) as in Proposition 2.8.3 is
given; we want to produce the generic extensions. To wit, we have to produce
the generic extensions as Borel functions on Y and also the valuation functions
for names in the ground models as Borel functions.
Proposition 2.8.4. There are Borel functions M[G]: Y →X and v: Y ×ω →
ω such that for every y ∈ Y, M[G](y) is a generic extension of M(y) by G(y)
and for every n∈ω, v(y)(n)=n/G(y) whenever M(y)|=n is a P(y)-name.
