is a choice-coherent sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of generic extensions of V and a

Definition 9.4.2. Let P be a Suslin forcing. The poset P is nested balanced
below κ if it has a nest below every condition.
As a simple initial example, let P be the poset of all countable functions from
2ω to 2, ordered by reverse inclusion. The balanced conditions are classified by
total functions from 2ω to 2. Now, let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a coherent sequence of

To state the results of this section succintly, we establish a standard parlance.
Definition 9.4.3. (ZF) The phrase “orbit divide is preserved” denotes the
following statement. Let E be an orbit equivalence relation on a Polish space
induced as an orbit equivalence relation of a Polish group action. Then |E | (cid:54)≤
1
|E|.
The central theorem can now be stated easily using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem9.4.4. InnestedbalancedextensionsofthesymmetricSolovaymodel,
the orbit divide is preserved.
Proof. SupposethatY isaPolishspace,ΓisaPolishgroupandΓcontinuously
acts on Y, inducing an orbit equivalence relation E. Suppose that κ is an
inaccessible cardinal and P is a Suslin poset which is nested balanced below κ.
Suppose also that W is a symmetric Solovay model derived from κ and in W,
τ is a P-name and p ∈ P is a condition forcing τ to be a function from the
E -quotient space to the E-quotient space. We must find a stronger condition
1
and two distinct E classes which are forced by the stronger condition to be
1
mapped to the same E-class.
TheobjectsΓ, Y, pandτ arealldefinableinthemodelW fromparameters
in the ground model plus a parameter z ∈ 2ω. Use the assumptions to find an
intermediate forcing extension V[K] by a poset of size <κ such that z ∈V[K]
and V[K] has a nest below p. Still working in W, find the nest. This is a
sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of generic extensions of V[K] together with a sequence
n
(cid:104)p¯ : n ≤ ω(cid:105) of balanced virtual conditions below p satisfying the demands of

Definition 9.4.1.
Use the coherence of the sequence (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) to find a well-ordering ≺ of
n
2ω in M such that for each n ∈ ω, ≺(cid:22) M ∈ M holds. Let z ∈ 2ω be the
0 n n n
≺-least element of M \M for every n ∈ ω and let x ∈ X = (2ω)ω be the
n n+1 n
point such that x (m) is the zero binary sequence if m<n and x (m)=z if
