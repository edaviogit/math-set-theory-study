over, if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair, then
1. if Q(cid:13)σ ≤τ then (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) is a balanced pair ≡ -related to (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105);

2. if Q is a regular subposet of R then (cid:104)R,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair ≡ -related to

It is now time for a simple and informative example. Let P be the poset of
countable functions from 2ω to 2, ordered by reverse inclusion. On one hand,
if f: 2ω → 2 is a total function, then (cid:104)Coll(ω,2ω),fˇ(cid:105) is a balanced pair. On
the other hand, if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair, then for every point x ∈ 2ω in
the ground model, it must be the case that Q forces fˇ(x) ∈ dom(τ) and in
fact Q has to decide the value of τ(xˇ) as well–otherwise it would be easy to
violate the balance of the pair. Let f: 2ω → 2 be the total function given by
∀x ∈ 2ω Q (cid:13) τ(xˇ) = fˇ(xˇ) and note that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)Coll(ω,2ω),fˇ(cid:105). Thus, the
b
balanced classes for P are exactly classified by total functions from 2ω to 2.

Theorem 5.2.5. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Every ≡ -class contains a
b
virtual condition. The condition is unique up to virtual condition equivalence.
Proof. Let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair; by Proposition 5.2.4 we may assume that
τ is a name for a single element of P. Consider the poset Q(cid:48) = Coll(ω,P(Q))
and the name τ(cid:48) for the analytic set {p ∈ P: for some filter G ⊂ Q meeting
all open dense sets enumerated by the Q(cid:48)-generic, p=τ/G}. We will first show
that the pair (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105) is balanced via Proposition 5.2.2.
