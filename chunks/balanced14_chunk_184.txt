show that Q×Coll(ω,X) (cid:13) σ ≤ τ , which implies the equivalence of σ and τ

by Proposition 5.2.4.
To prove the inequality σ ≤ τ , it is enough to show that Q (cid:13) (a \V)∩

( (I ∩V))=0. Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails, and let q ∈Q

Finally, (3) is immediate from the assumption that X = I.
Example 8.8.3. Let X =2ω, let Γ be the graph connecting points x,y ∈X if

Γ-cliquesandclosedΓ-anticliques. TheposetP addsagenericuncountableset

such that every Γ-clique or anticlique is countable. This exhibits a balanced
extension in which OCA fails, cf. Example 12.2.16.
Example 8.8.4. Let X = ωω and let I be the collection {x ≤ y: x ∈ X} for
all functions y ∈ ωω, where ≤ is the everywhere domination ordering on ωω.
The poset P adds a dominating subset of ωω which has only countably many
I
elements below any given function y ∈ωω. A set like this must fail to have the
Baire property. In a rather different language, Shelah [81] showed that in the
P -extension of the Solovay model every set is Lebesgue measurable, showing
I
that ZF+DC plus the statement “every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable”
does not imply that every set has the Baire property.
In the case when I is the collection of closed nowhere dense subsets of X,
there is a more sophisticated variation of the poset P . For a natural number
I
n ∈ ω, a set s ⊂ (2ω)n, and a partial function h: n → 2ω write s = {g ∈
h
(2ω)n\dom(h): h∪g ∈s}.

The order is that of coordinatewise reverse inclusion.
It is not difficult to check that P is a σ-closed Suslin partial ordering. The
poset adds an E -invariant Lusin subset of 2ω–an uncountable set which inter-

sects every nowhere dense set in a countable set. The generic set has a similar
property in all finite powers though, and in Example 12.2.17 it serves an even
more refined purpose. The balance of P is an immediate consequence of the
following classification theorem. For any E -invariant set a ⊂ 2ω, let τ be the
