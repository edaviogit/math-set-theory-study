The third item is immediate. The last sentence of the theorem is not an
entirely formal consequence of the previous work. It needs the following appli-
cation of the axiom of choice.

7.3. RAMSEY SEQUENCES OF STRUCTURES 163
Claim 7.3.6. Every A-sequence of filters can be extended to a A-sequence of
ultrafilters.
Proof. OrdertheA-sequencesoffiltersbycoordinatewiseinclusion: F ≤Giffor
every n∈ω, F ⊆G holds. It is immediate from the definitions that every ≤-
n n
chainhasanupperbound–thecoordinatewiseunionoftheA-sequencesoffilters
in the chain. By an application of Kuratowski–Zorn lemma, every A-sequence
of filters can be extended into a ≤-maximal one. It only remains to prove that
any ≤-maximal A-sequence of filters is in fact a sequence of ultrafilters.
Let F be a ≤-maximal A-sequence of filters, let n ∈ ω be a number, and
let b ⊂ D be a set; we claim that either b or its complement belongs to F .
n n
Suppose towards a contradiction that neither is the case. By the maximality
of F it must be the case that the sequences G0,G1 of filters obtained from F
by adding b (or the complement of b, respectively) to the filter F are not A-
n
sequences. This must be witnessed by some sets (cid:104)a0: i∈k(cid:105) and (cid:104)a1: i∈k(cid:105) for
i i
some number k ∈ ω respectively, and some number m ∈ ω: these are sets in

such that there is no d ∈ D

such that for all i ∈ k,i (cid:54)= n dAi ⊂ a0

or the sets (cid:104)ai: i∈k(cid:105).

Now, suppose that p ∈ P is a condition. Consider the sequence F of filters F
n
generated by sets cofinite in pAn. Clearly, F is an A-sequence. By the claim, F
can be extended to a A-sequence G of ultrafilters. Then (cid:104)Coll(ω,2ω),τ (cid:105) is a
G
balanced pair which is easily seen to be below p as required.
For every Ramsey sequence A = (cid:104)A : n ∈ ω(cid:105), the poset P introduces an
n A
ultrafilter on the set D as the set of all subsets a ⊂ D such that for some

confusion is minimal. The combinatorial and Rudin–Keisler properties of the
generic ultrafilter have been the main reason for the study of the partial orders
of the type P [8]. It is not difficult to see that it is a P-point.

Example 7.3.7. Let A be the sequence (cid:104)A : n ∈ ω(cid:105) where A is the linear
n n
order on n many elements. The Ramsey theorem implies that this is in fact a
Ramsey sequence of structures. The P -generic ultrafilter is a P-point which is
A
weakly Ramsey and not a Q-point [8, Theorem 4.9].
Example 7.3.8. Let k ∈ ω and let A be a sequence enumerating all ordered
finite graphs which contain no clique of size k. The fact that this is a Ramsey
