Fact 9.5.5. The poset Q is proper, bounding, and adds no independent reals.

9.5. THE E DIVIDE 231
Kσ
Proof. The first two assertions are well-known, and follow for example from [?,
Theorem 5.6] or [101, Theorem 5.2.6]. The third assertion is more difficult. It
can be derived from the work of [84, Section 4], and it appears explicitly in the
forthcoming [104].
The poset Q is designed to add an interesting model of ZF. In the Q-extension,
let (cid:104)x : n∈ω(cid:105) be the sequence of points Vitali-generic over the ground model
n
added by the product Q. Let A ⊂ ω × 2ω be the relation consisting of all
pairs (cid:104)n,x(cid:105) such that x is E -related to x . For each number n ∈ ω, let V be
0 n n
the model of all sets hereditarily definable from x for m ∈ n, A, and some
m
parametersinthegroundmodel. Also,letM bethemodelofallsetshereditarily
definablefromthesetAanditselements, andparametersinthegroundmodel.
We have the following:
Claim 9.5.6. 1. V ⊂V ⊂V ⊂···⊂M;
0 1 2
2. the sequence (cid:104)V : n∈ω(cid:105) belongs to M;
n
(cid:83)
3. every set of ordinals in M belongs to V ;
n n
4. the model M does not contain any uniformization of the set A.
Note also that the models V satisfy the axiom of choice, while the model M
n
fails even DC, as item (3) shows.
Proof. The first item follows directly from the definitions of the models V and
n
M: if m ∈ n ∈ ω are numbers then there are fewer definitions of elements
of the model V than of elements of the model V , and certainly fewer than
m n
the definitions of elements the model M. For (2), the sequence (cid:104)V : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is
n
definablefromthesetA,sinceinthedefinitionofthemodelV itcertainlydoes
n
not matter which E -equivalents of the points x for m ∈ n one uses as the
0 m
parameters. For(3),anydefinitionofasetofordinalsinthemodelM usesonly
finitely many parameters, and then must belong to the model V for a number
n
n large enough so that the parameters of the definition are definable from x
m
for m∈n, the set A, and some elements of the ground model.
Lastly, for (4), return to the ground model and assume towards a contra-
diction that some condition in Q forces (4) to fail. Then, in the poset Q, there
mustbeaconditionq,numbersn,k ∈ω andaformulaφsuchthatq forcesthat
the formula φ uses only parameters x˙ for m ∈ n, A, and some parameters in

the ground model, it defines a uniformization y of the set A, and y(n) agrees
withx˙ fromk on. Let(cid:104)x : m∈ω(cid:105)beaQ-genericsequenceofpointsmeeting

the condition q. By a basic analysis of the Vitali forcing in [101, Section 4.7.1],
there is also a point x(cid:48) ∈ 2ω E -related to x which differs from x at some
n 0 n n
pointpastk andsuchthat(cid:104)x : m(cid:54)=n,x(cid:48) (cid:105)isaQ-genericsequencemeetingthe

condition q. Applying the forcing theorem to the two sequences (cid:104)x : m ∈ ω(cid:105)
m
and (cid:104)x : m (cid:54)= n,x(cid:48) (cid:105), we see that the formula φ should define a uniformiza-
m n
tion y of the set A such that y(n) is equal to both x and x(cid:48) beyond k. This
n n
is impossible though as the two sequences x ,x(cid:48) do differ at some point past
n n
k.
