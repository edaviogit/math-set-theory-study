Another example of an independent pair of functions deals with Polish fields.
Theorem 3.2.7. Let Φ be an uncountable Polish field. Let X = {(cid:104)u ,u (cid:105) ∈

from X to the first and the second coordinate are independent.
Proof. Write f : X →Φ2 and f : X →Φ2 for the two projection functions. It

is not difficult to see that the maps f ,f are continuous and open. Towards
0 1
the independence, let O ⊂ (Φ2)2 be an open set with nonempty intersection
with X. Let (cid:104)u ,u (cid:105) be a point in X ∩O. Let v ∈ Φ2 be any nonzero vector

such that u ·v = 0. By the continuity of multiplication, there must be a

nonzero field element y ∈ Φ such that the pair (cid:104)u ,u +yv (cid:105) belongs to O; it

The following theorem is closely related to the previous one in view of the
fact that its statement is intended to be applied with algebraic curves.
Theorem3.2.8. LetC ⊂Rbeasmoothcurvecontainingnostraightsegments,
which is closed as a subset of R2. Let X = (cid:104)u ,u (cid:105) ∈ R2: u −u ∈ C}. The
0 1 0 1
projection functions from X to the first and second coordinate are independent.
Proof. Since the set C is closed, X ⊂ (R2)2 is closed and equipped with the
topology inherited from (R2)2. Let f : X → R2 and f : X → R2 be the
0 1
projection functions. Clearly, f and f are continuous. They are also open: if

the f -image of X∩O, as the points (cid:104)u +v,u +v(cid:105) belong not only to O but

also to X as u −u =(u +v)−(u +v).
