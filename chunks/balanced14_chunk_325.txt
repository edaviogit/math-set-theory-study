about lack of other combinatorial objects in the extensions under discourse. In
this section, we include several theorems that are hopefully elegant axiomatiza-
tions and generalizations of earlier results in [63].
14.1 Maximal almost disjoint families
OnerathersurprisinglimitationofbalancedextensionsofthesymmetricSolovay
model is that they contain no maximal almost disjoint families of subsets of ω.
The following theorem is stated using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 14.1.1. In cofinally balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model there are no infinite maximal almost disjoint families of subsets of ω.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin forcing such that P
is balanced below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model derived from κ and
workinW. Supposetowardsacontradictionthatthereisaconditionp∈P and
a name τ such that p forces τ to be an infinite maximal almost disjoint family.
The condition p as well as the name τ must be definable from some parameter
z ∈ 2ω and some parameters from the ground model. Use Fact 1.7.14 and the
assumptionstofindanintermediategenericextensionV[K]suchthatz ∈V[K]
and P is balanced in V[K]. Work in the model V[K].
Let p¯≤p be a balanced condition. Let I be the set {a⊂ω: for some poset
R of size <κ and some R -name σ for a condition in P stronger than p¯such

Claim 14.1.2. ω cannot be covered by a finite set and finitely many elements
of the set I.

Proof. Suppose that J ⊂ I is a finite set such that J ⊂ ω is co-finite. Let
H ⊂R for a∈J be filters mutually generic over V[K] and let p =σ /H ∈
