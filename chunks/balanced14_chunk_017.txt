the model W[B] fairly well:
Theorem 1.4.2. In the model W[B], the following statements hold:
1. (Proposition 9.2.22) E has a transversal;
0
2. (Corollary 9.4.30) E has a complete countable section;

1.4. INDEPENDENCE: BY MODEL 13
3. (Corollary 12.3.8) whenever X is an uncountable Polish field and Φ is a
countable subfield, there is no transcendence basis for X over Φ;
4. (Corollary 12.2.10) there is no diffuse probability measure on ω;
5. (Example 10.5.2) countable-to-one uniformization.
One can consider a different Polish vector space in place of R and add a basis

as a vector space over the binary field. The conclusions of the above theorem
remain in force. We do not know how to discern between the resulting models
in general.
If suitable large cardinals exist, one can find a Hamel basis generic over
the model L(R), independently of the size or structure of the continuum–
Example 12.4.4. The model L(R)[B] inherits all features quoted in Theo-
rem 1.4.2.
Models with a linear ordering. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a
Polish space X. Consider the poset P of linear orderings of countable subsets
of the E-quotient space, ordered by reverse extension. The generic filter yields
a linear ordering ≤ on the E-quotient space. The resulting model is a very
humble extension of the symmetric Solovay model.
Theorem 1.4.3. In the model W[≤], the following statements hold:
1. (Corollary 9.2.12) |E |>|2ω|;
0
2. (Corollary 9.4.10) |E |(cid:54)≤|F| for any orbit equivalence relation F;

3. (Corollary 13.3.15) there are no discontinuous homomorphism between
Polish groups;
4. (Corollary 12.2.15) OCA holds;
5. (Example 10.5.8) countable-to-one uniformization.
Other features may depend on the nature of the equivalence relation E. For
example, if E is pinned, then in the model W[≤] one cannot find a linear
ordering or even a tournament on the F -quotient space–Corollary 14.5.5. If

E is classifiable by countable structures, then in the model W[≤] cannot find a
