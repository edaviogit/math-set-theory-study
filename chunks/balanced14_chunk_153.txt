160 CHAPTER 7. ULTRAFILTER FORCINGS
Now, the former alternative is impossible as it contradicts the balance of
the pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105). To see this, let H ,H ⊂ Q be mutually generic filters and
0 1
let p = σ/H and p = σ/H . To reach the contradiction, we will show that
0 0 1 1
all vertical sections of p ∩p are finite. Suppose not, and let n ∈ ω be such
0 1
that (p ) ∩(p ) is infinite. Then U˙ /H = U˙ /H , which by the product

assumption.

is forced to be a subset of (ω×ω∗)V. Strengthening σ again, we may assume
that Q forces that for every set b⊂ω×ω∗ in the ground model, either η ⊂b or
η∩b=0 modulo finite.
Claim 7.2.3. For every set b ⊂ ω ×ω∗, either Q (cid:13) η ⊂ ˇb modulo finite, or
Q(cid:13)η∩ˇb is finite.
Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that the conclusion fails for some set
b ⊂ ω × ω∗. Then, there must be conditions q ,q ∈ Q forcing the former
0 1
and latter alternative respectively. Let H ,H ⊂ Q be mutually generic filters
0 1
containingtheconditionsq ,q respectively. Writep =σ/H andp =σ /H ;

we will reach a contradiction by showing that all but finitely many vertical
sections of the set p ∩p are finite, violating the balance assumption on σ.

Write c = η/H and c = η/H . By the contradictory assumption, the
0 0 1 1
intersection c ∩c is finite. Let n∈ω be a natural number which is not in the
0 1
finite projection of the set c ∩c to ω; we will show that (p ∩p ) is finite.

Let W be the set of all subsets of b ⊂ ω×ω∗ for which Q (cid:13) η ⊂ˇb modulo
finite; by the claim, this is an ultrafilter on ω×ω∗. The definitions show that
Coll(ω,P(ω × ω∗)) × Q (cid:13) σ ∈ τ . Then, Proposition 5.2.4 shows that the

balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(ω×ω∗)) are equivalent as desired.
Item (3) is immediate. For the last sentence, suppose that p ∈ P is a
condition. Let a={n∈ω: p is infinite}; the set a is infinite. For each n∈ω
