Proof. Items (1) and (2) are immediate. To prove (3), suppose that τ is an
E+-pinned name on a poset P. For every virtual E-class y, the statement
φ(y) =“rng(τ) contains a realization of the class y” must be decided in the
same way by every condition in P. Let S be any set of E-pinned names which
collects representatives from all virtual E-classes y such that ∀p∈P p(cid:13)φ(yˇ).
We claim that the set S works.
Indeed, suppose that G ,G ⊂ P are mutually generic filters. The sets

[rng(τ/G )] and[rng(τ/G )] areequal,andbyProposition2.1.7theycontain

only realizations of ground model virtual E-classes. By the choice of the set S,
thesesetscontainexactlyrealizationsofvirtualE-classesrepresentedbynames

Example 2.3.5. The relation F is the Friedman–Stanley jump of the identity
2
on X = 2ω. The identity is pinned by Fact 2.3.2 so its virtual classes can be
identified with elements of X. The F -classes then correspond to subsets of 2ω.
