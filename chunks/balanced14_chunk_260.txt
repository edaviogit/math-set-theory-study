ugh to consider the case of G which is a principal skew product as in Defi-
nition 11.1.7. Let (cid:104)a ,H ,t : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a sequence such that H = {a } and

11.4. LOCALLY COUNTABLE SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES 273
Write X for the Polish space which is the domain of the Borel simplicial
complex K, write E =E and P =P . Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal, let
K KL
W be the Solovay model derived from κ and work in the model W. Suppose
(cid:81)
that p ∈ P is a condition and τ is a P-name for a function from a to ω.
n n
We must find a stronger condition p¯≤ p, a number m ∈ ω and a G-hyperedge
e such that p¯(cid:13)τ(y)=mˇ for all vertices y ∈eˇ.
The condition p∈P as well as the name τ are definable from some parame-
tersinthegroundmodelandaparameterz ∈2ω. LetV[K]beanintermediate
model obtained by a poset of size < κ containing the parameter z, and work
in the model V[K] until further notice. Consider the iteration Q∗R˙ where Q
(cid:81) (cid:81)
is the Cohen poset on a adding a generic point y˙ ∈ a , and in the
n n gen n n
Q-extension, R˙ is the finite support iteration of length ω of the poset K. As

usual, the poset K is reinterpreted at each stage of the iteration; we denote
the model obtained after α-th stage by M , so M is the Q-extension of V[K].

Thus, the R˙ poset adds a sequence of K-sets, (cid:104)A˙ : α∈ω (cid:105) derived from the it-

in the model V , the set A˙ ∩c is a maximal K-subset of c which is L-regular.

Consider the Q∗R˙-name p¯for the K-set defined in the following way: if c is an
E-class represented in dom(p), then c∩p¯=c∩p, if c is an E-class represented
in M but not in dom(p) then c∩p¯ = A˙ ∩c, and if α ∈ ω is an arbitrary

K-set which is L-large, and therefore a balanced condition for the poset P by

the condition q ∈Q if necessary, we may assume that
