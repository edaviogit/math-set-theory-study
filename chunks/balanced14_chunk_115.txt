certain critical features. This leads to the following definition:
Definition 5.1.2. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing.
1. Let Q be a poset and τ a Q-name for an analytic subset of P. We say
that the name τ is P-pinned if Q×Q(cid:13)Στ =Στ in the completion
left right
of the separative quotient of the poset P. If τ is P-pinned, then the pair
(cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) is called a P-pin.
2. Let(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)and(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)beP-pins. Define(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)≤(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)ifQ ×Q (cid:13)

3. The virtual conditions of P are the equivalence classes of ≡.
For the last item of the above definition, we must verify that ≡ is in fact an
equivalence relation. This is the content of the following propositions. As the
first technical remark, note that for analytic sets A ,A ⊂ P, the statement
0 1
ΣA ≤ ΣA is equivalent to ∀p ∈ P ∀p ∈ A p ≤ p → ∃q ≤ p ∃p ∈
1 0 1 1 1 0
A q ≤ p . Since the ordering ≤ on P is analytic, this is a Π1 statement and
0 0 2
therefore absolute among all generic extensions by the Shoenfield absoluteness.
As another remark, since any two generic extensions are mutually generic with
a third, (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a P-pin just in case in every forcing extension V[H] and every
pair of filters G ,G ⊂ Q in V[H] separately generic over V, Στ/G = Στ/H
0 1 0 1
holds in the completion of the separative quotient of P. Similarly, it is possible
to restate the definitions of ≤ and ≡ without mutual genericity.
Proposition 5.1.3. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Let (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105), (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105) be
0 0 1 1
posets and names for analytic subsets of P. The following statements are abso-
lute among all forcing extensions:
1. (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105) is a P-pin;
0 0
2. (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)≤(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105);
1 1 0 0
3. (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)≡(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105).

Proof. We will prove (2), the other items are parallel. Suppose first that
(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)≤(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105) holds, and V[H] is a generic extension of V; we must verify
1 1 0 0
that the ≤-relation transfers to V[H]. To see this, suppose that G ⊂Q ,G ⊂

Thus,A ,A ⊂P areanalyticsetswithcodesinV[G ]andV[G ],respectively.

By the assumption, V[G ,G ] |= ΣA ≤ ΣA in the completion of the separa-

tive quotient of the poset P. This Π1 statement transfers to V[H][G ,G ] by

the Shoenfield absoluteness. In conclusion, V[H][G ,G ] |= ΣA ≤ ΣA and
0 1 1 0
therefore V[H]|=(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)≤(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105).
