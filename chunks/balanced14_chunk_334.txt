352 CHAPTER 14. OTHER COMBINATORICS
Theorem 14.4.9. In definably balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model, |E |(cid:54)≤|F| holds for every pinned Borel orbit equivalence relation F.

Proof. LetΓbeaPolishgroupcontinuouslyactingonaPolishspaceX,inducing
an equivalence relation F. Suppose that F is pinned. Suppose that P is a
Suslin forcing. Suppose further that κ is an inaccessible cardinal such that P
is definably balanced below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model derived
from κ and work in W. Suppose that p ∈ P is a condition and τ is a P-name
suchthatp(cid:13)τ isafunctionfromtheE -quotientspacetotheF-quotientspace.

extension obtained from a poset of size < κ such that z ∈ V[K]. Work in the
model V[K]. Let Q be the finite support product of uncountably many copies
of the Cohen forcing. Use the definable balance assumption to find a Q-name
η for a real and a condition q ∈ Q which identifies a definition of a virtual
balanced condition p¯≤ p with a parameter η. By Fact 14.4.6, passing into a
larger intermediate extension, we may assume that η is in fact a name for a
specificelementofV[K]. Forthebrevityofnotation, weneglectη andq below.
Let H ⊂ Q be a filter generic over V[K] and work in the model V[K][H]
for the moment. Note that the equivalence relation F is pinned there by The-
orem 2.7.1. By a balance argument with p¯, for every E -class c in the model
1
V[K][H] there is an F-class d such that Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)p¯(cid:13) τ(c)=d. Go back
P
to V[K]. Fix a Q-name h˙ for the map c (cid:55)→ d. Note that h˙ is forced to be a
definable injection from the E -quotient space to the F-quotient space.

Let y ∈(2ω)ω be a sequence of points in 2ω generic over V[K] for the finite
support product of the usual Cohen forcing. Working in the model V[K][y], by
Fact 14.4.6, there is a point x∈X such that Q(cid:13)h˙([y]E
