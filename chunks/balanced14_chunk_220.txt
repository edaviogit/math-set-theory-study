It is not hard to see that the first item implies that the intersection V[H ]∩

V[H ] is a model of ZF, since it is weakly universal and closed under the G¨odel

the extensions V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic over it by Proposition 1.7.8.

However, we will be interested exactly in the situations where the intersection
fails to satisfy even DC. The following is a simple observation which will be
critical later.

Proof. Let x ∈ V[H ] and x ∈ V[H ] be points in ωω below the identity

Since y ∩a = 0, it must be the case that y is E -related to both x ,x as
