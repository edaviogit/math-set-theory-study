virtual E-classes which are not represented in V. The following propositions
encapsulate the basic properties of the two classes of equivalence relations.
Proposition 3.3.3. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. E is virtually placid if and only if for any separately generic extensions
V[H ],V[H ] such that V[H ]∩V[H ] = V and E-related points x ∈ V[H ]
0 1 0 1 0 0
and x ∈V[H ], x and x are realizations of some virtual E-class in V.

that both E-pins are E¯-related to some E-pin from V.
Proposition 3.3.4. An analytic equivalence relation E on a Polish space X is
placid if and only if it is pinned and virtually placid.
Proof. Theright-to-leftimplicationisimmediate. IfE isapinnedandvirtually

class must be trivial by the pinned assumption. This means that E is placid.
For the left-to-right implication, if E is placid then it must be pinned because
if V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic extensions then V[H ]∩V[H ] = V by

theproductforcingtheorem. Toshow thatE must be virtually placid, suppose
that V[H ], V[H ] are separately generic extensions. By Proposition 3.3.3, it is

enough to verify that every E-class represented in both extensions is a realiza-
tion of some virtual E-class in V. However, the placid assumption even implies
that it is a realization of a trivial virtual E-class in V.
A good example of an equivalence relation which is virtually placid but not
placid is F . It is not placid since it is not pinned.

The following ergodicity theorem is a great generalization of the ergodicity
theorems of Hjorth and Kechris [52, Theorem 12.5], and it is the main motiva-
tion behind the definition of placid and virtually placid classes of equivalence
relations.
Theorem 3.3.5. Suppose that a Polish group Γ acts continuously and in a
genericallyturbulentwayonaPolishspaceX suchthattheresultingorbitequiv-
alence relation E is analytic, with all orbits dense. Suppose that F is a virtually
placid equivalence relation on a Polish space Y. Suppose that h: X → Y is
a homomorphism of E to F. Then there is a comeager set B ⊂ X which is
mapped into a single F-class.
Proof. Let γ ∈Γ,x∈X be a mutually generic pair of points for the posets P
Γ
and P . Theorem 3.2.2 implies the instrumental equality: V[x]∩V[γ·x]=V.
