P are compatible conditions. By the definition of the name τ(cid:48), in V[H ] it is

with r , and similarly in the model V[G ]. Let s ,s ∈ P be lower bounds of

r and p in V[G ] and r and p in V[G ] respectively. Since (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) was a

balanced condition in P, the conditions s ,s must be compatible in P, and

their lower bound is a lower bound of r and r as well.

To show that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105), use both parts (1) and (2) of Proposi-
b
tion 5.2.4 with the intermediate pair (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105). To show that the pair (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105)
is a virtual condition, suppose that G(cid:48),G(cid:48) ⊂ Q(cid:48) are mutually generic filters.

Looking at the model V[G ,G ], it in fact turns out that τ(cid:48)/G(cid:48) and τ(cid:48)/G(cid:48) are
0 1 0 1
in fact equal as analytic subsets of P.
To show the uniqueness of the virtual condition (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105) up to the virtual
condition equivalence, suppose that (cid:104)Q(cid:48)(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:105) is another virtual condition which
is an element of the ≡ -class of the balanced class of (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105); we must show
b
that Q(cid:48) ×Q(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:13) Στ(cid:48) = Στ(cid:48)(cid:48). For the ≤ direction, suppose that G(cid:48) ⊂ Q(cid:48) and
G(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊂ Q(cid:48)(cid:48) are mutually generic filters and r ∈ P is a condition in V[G(cid:48),G(cid:48)(cid:48)]
which is below Στ(cid:48)/G(cid:48); we must show that it is compatible with some element
of τ(cid:48)(cid:48)/G(cid:48)(cid:48). Let H ⊂ Q(cid:48)(cid:48) be a filter generic over the model V[G(cid:48),G(cid:48)(cid:48)]. Since the
pairs (cid:104)Q(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:105) and (cid:104)Q(cid:48)(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:105) come from the same balanced class, the condition r
must be compatible with every element of τ(cid:48)(cid:48)/H. Let s∈V[G(cid:48),G(cid:48)(cid:48),H] be such
that s ≤ r and s ≤ Στ(cid:48)(cid:48)/H. Since the pair (cid:104)Q(cid:48)(cid:48),τ(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:105) is a virtual condition, the
condition s ≤ Στ(cid:48)(cid:48)/H must be compatible with some condition of τ(cid:48)(cid:48)/G(cid:48)(cid:48). By

Question 5.2.6. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Is it necessarily the case that
the equivalence relation ≡ has only set many classes? Is it necessarily the case
b
that every balance class has a representative on a poset of size <(cid:105) ?

It is now time to state the central definition of this book.
Definition 5.2.7. Let P be a Suslin poset. P is balanced if for every condition
p∈P there is a balanced virtual condition below p.
A definition of this sort immediately raises a question: which Suslin posets are
balanced? Weshouldimmediatelydousetheflamesofentirelymisguidedhopes:
Proposition 5.2.8. The following Suslin posets do not have any balanced vir-
tual conditions and therefore are not balanced:
1. nonatomic c.c.c. posets;
2. nonatomic tree posets;
3. posets of the form P(ω)/I where I is a countably separated Borel ideal on
ω.
