Definition 3.1.3. LetX,Y ,Y bePolishspacesandf : X →Y andf : X →
0 1 0 0 1
Y be continuous open maps. The functions f ,f are independent if for every
1 0 1
nonempty open set O ⊂ X there is a nonempty open set A ⊂ Y such that for
0
all nonempty open subsets B ,B ⊂A there is a walk consisting of points in O

starting in f−1B and ending in f−1B .

It may appear that the definition is not symmetric with respect to the maps
f ,f . In fact, the definition is symmetric, and this follows as a small corollary

from the following central theorem.
Theorem 3.1.4. Suppose that X,Y ,Y are Polish spaces and f : X →Y and
0 1 0 0
f : X →Y are continuous open maps. The following are equivalent:

1. f ,f are independent;

2. P (cid:13) V[f (x˙ )]∩V[f (x˙ )] = V where x˙ is the P -name for the
X 0 gen 1 gen gen X
generic element of X.
Proof. For the (1)→(2) implication, we need a preliminary definition and a
claim. Let k ∈ ω be a number. A walk of open sets of length k is a sequence
(cid:104)O : i ≤ k(cid:105) of nonempty open subsets of X such that for each i ∈ k, either
i
f(cid:48)(cid:48)O =f(cid:48)(cid:48)O or f(cid:48)(cid:48)O =f(cid:48)(cid:48)O .

Claim 3.1.5. Let k ∈ ω be a number. Suppose that (cid:104)x : i ≤ k(cid:105) is a walk of
i
points, O ⊂ X are open sets such that x ∈ O , and D is a finite collection
i i i
of open subsets of X. Then there is a walk (cid:104)P : i ≤ k(cid:105) of open sets such that
i
P ⊂ O holds for each i ≤ k and for each U ∈ D and each i ≤ k, P is either
i i i
disjoint from U or a subset of U.
Proof. By induction on k. The case k = 0 is trivial. Suppose that the claim
has been proved for k and (cid:104)x : i≤k+1(cid:105) is a walk of points, O are open sets,
i i
and D is a finite collection of open subsets of X. Suppose for definiteness that
f (x ) = f (x ). Shrinking O and O if necessary, we may assume that
0 k 0 k+1 k k+1
f(cid:48)(cid:48)O =f(cid:48)(cid:48)O . For each open set U ∈D let U(cid:48) = (cid:83) {V ⊂X: V is open and
0 k 0 k+1
f−1f(cid:48)(cid:48)V ⊂U} and let E ={U(cid:48): U ∈D}. By the induction hypothesis, there is
0 0
a walk (cid:104)P : i≤k(cid:105) of open sets such that P ⊂O and P is either disjoint from
i i i i
or a subset of each element of D∪E. Let P =f−1f(cid:48)(cid:48)P ∩O and observe
k+1 0 0 k k+1
that the walk (cid:104)P : i≤k+1(cid:105) of open sets works as required.
