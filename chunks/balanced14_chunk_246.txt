all vertical sections of the set A have λ-mass ≥ 2−n. By the Fubini theorem,
there is a horizontal section of A of µ-mass ≥ 2−n. This horizontal section is
the desired G-anticlique of µ-mass ≥2−n.

The class of analytic finitary hypergraphs which do not have Borel σ-bounded
fractional chromatic number has a simple basis.
Definition 11.1.21. Suppose that (cid:104)a ,H ,t : n∈ω(cid:105) is a sequence such that
n n n
a is a nonempty finite set, H is a hypergraph on a such that every H -

then called a large measured skew product.
A straightforward Baire category argument shows that a large measured skew
product does not have Borel σ-bounded fractional chromatic number. The fol-
lowing fact is proved in the same way as the G -dichotomy, and we omit the
0
standard argument.
Fact 11.1.22. Let G be a finitary analytic hypergraph on a Polish space X.
Exactly one of the following occurs:
1. G has Borel σ-bounded fractional chromatic number;
2. there is a large measured skew product H on a Polish space Y and a
continuous homomorphism h: Y →X of H to G.
We now include two definitions and related dichotomies which deal with the
clique number of Borel graphs.
