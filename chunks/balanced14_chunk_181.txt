190 CHAPTER 8. OTHER FORCINGS
Claim 8.6.10. Q forces that no element of σ which is not a realization of a
virtual E-class is algebraic over a tuple of virtual E-classes from the ground
model.
Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails, and let q ∈ Q be a
condition, let η be a Q-name for an element of σ which is not a realization of a
virtual E-class, and let φ be a formula,(cid:126)c a tuple of virtual E-classes and n∈ω
be a natural number such that q (cid:13)σ |= there are precisely n many x such that
φ(x,(cid:126)c) holds, and η is one of them. Let H ,H ⊂Q be mutually generic filters
0 1
over the ground model, both containing q, and let p = σ/H and p = σ/H .
0 0 1 1
We will show that p ,p have no lower bound in the poset P , reaching a
0 1 TE
contradiction with the balance assumption on the pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105).
Suppose then that q is such a lower bound. By elementaricity, q must see

in q. Now, p already sees n many solutions, and η/H is another solution in
0 1
p which does not belong to p or even to V[H ]. Thus, q in fact sees at least
1 0 0
n+1 many solutions,a contradiction.
It follows that S is a balanced theory, and also that Coll(ω,(cid:105) )×Q(cid:13)σ ∈τ .

The equivalence of the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) then follows

there is a model M of the theory T on the virtual E-quotient space in which p
is an elementary submodel. Let S be the diagram of M and observe that S is
a balanced theory and its corresponding balanced condition is below p.
Example8.6.11. LetT bethetheoryofdenselinearorderswithoutendpoints.
The notion of algebraicity is trivial in the theory T, and T has elimination of
quantifiers. It follows that the balanced theories are exactly the linear orders
on the set of virtual E-classes. This should be compared to Example 8.6.5.
8.7 Non-DC variations
All of the partial orders exhibited so far are either σ-closed or ℵ -distributive,
0
and therefore their corresponding extensions of the symmetric Solovay model
satisfy DC, the Axiom of Dependent Choices. This is normaly viewed as highly
desirable,asDCisakeytoolfordevelopingmathematicalanalysisanddescrip-
tive set theory as we know them today. However, balanced forcing can be used
to generate extensions of the symmetric Solovay model in which DC fails. We
include one striking example.
Definition 8.7.1. Let X be an uncountable Polish space. The finite-countable
poset P associated with X consists of pairs p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) where a ⊂ X is a
p p p
finite set, b ⊂ X is a countable set, and a ∩b = 0. The ordering is that of
