Corollary 9.3.17. Let X be an uncountable Polish space.
1. In the extension of the symmetric Solovay model by the acyclic decompo-
sition poset, the turbulent divide is preserved;
2. it is consistent relatively to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
there is an acyclic decomposition of [X]2, and yet the turbulent divide is
preserved.
We conclude this section with several non-examples.
Example 9.3.18. Let E be the equivalence relation on 2ω connecting sets
x,y if Σ{ 1 : n ∈ x∆y} is finite. E is a Borel orbit equivalence relation of a
n+1
turbulentPolishgroupaction;itiswell-knowntobepinned. LetP betheposet
of countable partial E-transversals ordered by reverse inclusion. The poset P
is balanced by Corollary 6.6.4, but not placid: in fact, it is designed to collapse
the turbulent divide as it forces |E|≤|2ω|.
Example 9.3.19. LetX beanuncountablePolishfieldandF ⊂X beacount-
able subfield. The poset P of countable subsets of X which are algebraically
independent over F, with the reverse inclusion ordering is balanced. It is not
placid by Theorem 12.3.1 below. We do not know if in the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, the turbulent divide is preserved.
Example 9.3.20. The poset P of infinite subsets of ω ordered by inclusion is
balanced. It is not placid by Theorem 12.2.3 below. We do not know if in the
P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model, the turbulent divide is preserved.

It is then tempting to think that in many models which we study, |E | cannot

be smaller than |E| where E is an orbit equivalence relation. This question is
with some success addressed in the present section. The following definition
connects coherent sequences of generic extensions with Suslin forcings.
Definition 9.4.1. Let P be a Suslin forcing. A nest below a condition p ∈ P
is a choice-coherent sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of generic extensions of V and a
n
sequence (cid:104)p¯ : n≤ω(cid:105) so that
