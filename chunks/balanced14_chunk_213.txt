Consider the set B ⊂ X of all points x ∈ X for which there is a countable set

9.4. THE ORBIT DIVIDE 223
• either for every countable set b⊂X there is y ∈/ b such that x∈o(y)⊂a;
• or for every countable set b ⊂ X there is y ∈ X such that (cid:104)y,x(cid:105) ∈(cid:126)Γ and
o(y)\a is a nonempty set disjoint from b.
A careful complexity computation shows that the set B is Σ1. The following

claim uses the properness assumption:
Claim 9.4.18. Whenever n∈ω is a number and y ∈X∩M \M is a point
n n+1
and (cid:104)y,x(cid:105)∈(cid:126)Γ, then x∈B or x∈M \M .
n n+1
Proof. Supposethatx∈M ; wemustshowthatx∈B. Theseto(y)∩M
n+1 n+1
is countable in M ; by the properness assumption, it is covered by a set a ∈
n
M which is countable in M . We claim that a is a witness to x ∈ B.
n+1 n+1
Indeed, if o(y)⊂M then x∈B by the first item in the definition of B–the
n+1
point y is not in M and so it does not belong to any countable set in M .
n+1 n+1
On the other hand, if o(y) ⊂ M then x ∈ B by the second item in the
n+1
definition of B–the nonempty set o(y)\a is disjoint from any countable set in
M .

Now, work in M . Let ≺ be a coherent well-ordering of P(X), and for every

number n ∈ ω let C ∈ M be the ≺-least maximal Γ-anticlique in the set
