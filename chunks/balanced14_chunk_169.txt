the complex K(Γ,∆) without having additional information on the
nature of the two groups. In this section, we will deal with a very special case
which nevertheless resolves some interesting problems.

178 CHAPTER 8. OTHER FORCINGS
Theorem 8.2.2. Let Γ,∆ be abelian Polish groups on respective Polish spaces
X,Y. Suppose that ∆ is divisible. Then the poset P(Γ,∆) is Suslin and
1. for every homomorphism h: Γ → ∆, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X ×Y),hˇ(cid:105) is bal-
anced;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a homomorphism h: Γ → ∆ such
that the pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X ×Y),hˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct homomorphisms yield inequivalent balanced virtual conditions.
In particular, the poset P(Γ,∆) is balanced.
Proof. Write K = K(Γ,∆) and P = P(Γ,∆). For the Suslinness of P, it is
enough to argue that the simplicial complex K is Borel. For that, note that
a finite partial function a ⊂ X ×Y belongs to K if and only if for every Z-
combinations Σ n γ =Σ n γ of elements of P, it is the case that Σ n a(γ )=
i i i j j j i i i
Σ n a(γ ). Theleft-to-rightimplicationisclear, sincetherighthandsideholds

for every homomorphism from Γ to ∆. For the right-to-left implication, note
that the assumption on the right hand side implies that a can be extended to a
homomorphism from the subgroup generated by dom(a) to ∆, which then can
be extended to a homomorphism of all of Γ to ∆ by the divisibility assumption
on ∆ and Baer’s criterion [3].
For (1), suppose that V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic extensions of the

that a ∪h and a ∪h are K-sets. We need to show that a ∪a ∈K. Towards

a contradiction, suppose that this fails, and write a = a ∪a . By the work

of the previous paragraph, there must be a Z-combinations Σ n γ = Σ n γ
i i i j j j
such that Σ n a(γ ) (cid:54)= Σ n a(γ ). Note that elements of both a ,a must be
i i i j j j 0 1
used in these combinations. Rearranging the combinations, we may assume
that the left combination uses only elements from a and the right one uses

only elements of a . By the product forcing theorem, γ = Σ n γ = Σ n γ

must belong to V. Since both a and a form a K-set with the homomorphism

h, the outputs Σ n a(γ ),Σ n a(γ ) must both be equal to h(γ), and therefore
i i i j j j
cannot be distinct, a contradiction.
This also means that P forces that the union of the generic filter is a total

(2), let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair. Strengthening τ if necessary, we may assume
that for each point γ ∈ Γ∩V Q (cid:13) τ(γˇ) ∈ dom(τ). Now, fix a point γ ∈ Γ.
By a balance argument, for every basic open set O ⊂ ∆ it must be the case
that either Q (cid:13) τ(γ) ∈ O˙ or Q (cid:13) τ(γ) ∈/ O˙. This means that there is a single
point δ(γ)∈∆ which is in the intersection of all open sets O ⊂∆ for which the
former option prevails; it must be the case that Q(cid:13)τ(γ)=δ(γ). The function
h: γ (cid:55)→ δ(γ) must be a homomorphism from Γ to ∆. Clearly Q (cid:13) τ ≤ hˇ; by
Proposition 5.2.4, the pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X ×Y),hˇ(cid:105) are equivalent.
Finally, (3) is obvious. For the last sentence, note that every condition
