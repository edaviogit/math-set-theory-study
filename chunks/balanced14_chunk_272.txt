then σ(y) is the smallest element of b which is distinct from all colors p(x)
η0(y)
for points x∈dom(p) which are Γ-connected with y. If α>0 then let σ(y) be
the smallest element of b which is distinct from all colors p(x) for points
(cid:83)
ηα(y)
x ∈ X ∩ M which are Γ-connected with y. Note that the definition is
β∈α β
correct as the number of colors in the set b we must avoid is at most n by
ηα(y)
the claim and the initial assumption on p.
Now, observe that σ is really a name for a Γ-coloring. To see this, suppose
that y ,y ∈ X are Γ-connected points which appear in the models M and
0 1 α0
M respectively. For definiteness assume that α ≤ α holds. If α = α ,
α1 0 1 0 1
then σ(y ) (cid:54)= σ(y ) must hold as η(y ) (cid:54)= η(y ) holds. If α < α then σ(y )

is distinct from all colors of points assigned to the points Γ-connected to y

and belonging to the models with smaller index, in particular σ(y ) (cid:54)= σ(y ).

Total Γ colorings are balanced virtual conditions in P by Theorem 8.1.2.
Thus, writing χ for the Q-name for the generic element of ωω added by the
poset Q, a balance argument shows that Q∗R˙ (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ decides in
P the value of τ(χ). Let (cid:104)q,r˙(cid:105) be a condition in the iteration Q∗R˙ and let
m∈ω beanumbersuchthat(cid:104)q,r˙(cid:105)(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13)τ(χ)=mˇ. Byachain
condition argument, there is a countable ordinal α such that q (cid:13) r˙ ∈ R˙ , the
α
intial segment of the iteration R of length α.
The poset K is very Suslin and Suslin σ-liminf-centered by Theorems 11.5.3
and11.5.4. ItfollowsbyTheorem11.3.20thatR isSuslinσ-liminf-centered;let

R = A be its cover by analytic liminf-centered pieces. Strengthening q if

q is one of the finite sequences used in the definition in the skew product ∆.
Let y ∈ ωω be a point Cohen generic over V[K] such that q ⊂ y, and for each
number l∈ω let y ∈ωω be the point resulting from rewriting the first entry of
l
y past q with l. Thus, the points y form a ∆-clique, they are all Cohen-generic

overV[K],andtheyallgeneratethemodelV[K][y]. Bytheliminf-centeredness
of the set A , there is a condition s ∈ R which forces the set {l ∈ ω: r˙/y

belongs to the generic filter} to be infinite. Let H ⊂ R be a filter generic over

Theorem 11.5.8. Let Γ be a Borel hypergraph on a Polish space X containing
no injective homomorphic image of K for some n ∈ ω. Let ∆ be a Borel
n,n
graph which does not have Borel σ-bounded clique number. In the P -extension
Γ
of the symmetric Solovay model, the chromatic number of ∆ is uncountable.
Proof. In view of Fact 11.1.24, it is enough to prove the theorem for a specific
(cid:81)
graph ∆. Let Y be the product (n+1) and let ∆ be the graph on Y which
n
is the skew product of cliques on the sets n+1 for n ∈ ω. The proof now
