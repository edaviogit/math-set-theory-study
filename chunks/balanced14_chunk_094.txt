Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Consider the set c = {i ∈

time to use the skew assumption on the ideal I. Find a set c(cid:48) ⊂ c witnessing
the skew property of I+. Use the definition of the jump to find a set e∈I such
that for all n ∈ ω, d∩a ∈/ I implies e∩a (cid:54)= 0. Since the set c(cid:48) is positive in

the jump, there must be a number n∈ω such that c(cid:48)∩a ∈/ I and e∩a =0.

The choice of the set c(cid:48) shows that c(cid:48)∩a is in fact I+-positive. The choice of

the set e shows that d∩a ∈ I. This means that x (cid:22) a = x (cid:22) a , and by

the placid assumption on the equivalence relation = , n ∈ b must hold. This

stands in contradiction with the fact that c(cid:48)∩a , so c∩a is I+-positive. The

proof of the theorem is complete.
Example 3.4.10. Let I be the branch ideal on 2ω, and let {a : n∈ω} be an
n
enumeration of the basic open subsets of 2<ω. The ideal I is skew. One can
start iterating the jump for countable ordinals α, at limit stages taking unions.
The resulting ideals consist of subsets of ω<ω whose closure in 2ω is countable
with Cantor–Bendixson rank ≤ α. All the resulting equivalence relations are
placid.

sections of forcing extensions of independent interest. The computation starts
with several definitions:
Definition 3.5.1. Let B be a Boolean algebra. A subalgebra A⊂B is projec-
tive if the projection function π: B → A, assigning to each b ∈ B the smallest
element of A which is ≥b, is defined for every b.
A good example of a projection is any complete subalgebra of a complete
Boolean algebra. The point of the current definition is that the property of
