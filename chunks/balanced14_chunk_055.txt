we will introduce several jump operations which have direct translations into
cardinal arithmetic operations. Using this approach, one can formally encode

ity results between Borel or analytic equivalence relations. For brevity, given
a coanalytic class Γ of structures on ω invariant under isomorphism, we write
κ(Γ) for κ(E ) in this section.
Γ
The constructions in this section depend on certain types of jump operators
on structures and equivalence relation. They are all provisionally denoted by
the+sign,nottobeconfusedwiththeFriedman–Stanleyjump. Thefirstjump
operation on equivalence relations we will consider translates into the powerset
operation using the pinned cardinal:
Definition 2.5.13. Let Γ be a coanalytic class of structures on ω, invariant
under isomorphism. Γ+ is the class of structures on ω of the following descrip-
tion: there is a partition ω =a∪b into two infinite sets, there is a Γ-structure
on a, and there is an extra relation R on b×a such that the vertical sections
R for m∈b are pairwise distinct subsets of a.

Proposition 2.5.14. Let Γ be a coanalytic class of structures on ω, invariant
under isomorphism.
1. Γ+ is coanalytic, and if Γ is Borel then so is Γ+;
2. if Γ consists of rigid structures, then so does Γ+;
3. if Γ consists of rigid structures and κ(Γ)=λ+ then κ(Γ+)=(2λ)+.
Proof. The first two items are obvious. For (3), suppose that κ(Γ)=λ+. Then
there must be a Γ∗∗ structure M of size λ and no Γ∗∗ structures of larger
size. By Theorem 2.4.5 and (2), every virtual E -class is associated with a Γ∗∗
Γ
structure. Every(Γ+)∗∗-structureconsistsofaΓ∗∗-structureandsomefamilyof
its pairwise distict subsets; the largest such structure then is of size 2λ exactly.
This completes the proof.
Corollary 2.5.15. For every countable ordinal α there is a Borel class Γ of
rigid structures such that κ(E )=(cid:105)+.
