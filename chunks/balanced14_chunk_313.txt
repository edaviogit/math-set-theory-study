Theorem 13.2.1 has a counterpart for certain quotient groups. Suppose that I

is a Borel ideal on ω. The quotient space P(ω)/I will be viewed as a group
with the (quotient of the) symmetric difference operation. A homomorphism
h: P(ω)/I →P(ω)/J is Borel if the set {(cid:104)x,y(cid:105)∈P(ω)×P(ω): h([x] )=[y] }

is Borel.
Theorem 13.2.3. Let I,J be Borel ideals on ω containing all singletons and
suppose that the modulo J equality is a pinned equivalence relation. Let n ∈ ω
be a number. In cofinally n+1,n-balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model, all homomorphisms of P(ω)/I to P(ω)/J are Borel.
The assumptions are satisfied in particular for the F -ideals J (as then the

17.1.3 (iii)]) and for the analytic P-ideals J (as they are Borel and Polishable
by [85]. The modulo J equality is an orbit equivalence relation of the action of
the Polish abelian group J by the symmetric difference, and orbit equivalence
relations of abelian Polish groups are pinned by [48, Theorem 17.1.3 (ii)]).
Proof. Write E for the modulo I equality and F for modulo J equality, both
Borel equivalence relations on X = P(ω). Suppose that κ is an inaccessible
cardinal. SupposethatP isaSuslinforcingwhichisisn+1,n-balancedcofinally
below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model derived from κ and work in
W. Suppose towards a contradiction that the conclusion of the theorem fails.
Thus, there is a condition p ∈ P and a P-name τ such that p forces τ is a
homomorphism. Both p and τ must be definable in W from parameters in the

Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a n + 1,n-balanced condition.
Consider the Cohen poset Q on X adding a generic set x˙ ⊂ ω. There are

two cases.

This case in fact leads to a contradiction. Write ∆ for the symmetric difference
operation on X and utilize its associativity to apply it also to finite tuples of
subsets of ω. Let X¯ ={x¯∈Xn+1: ∆ x(i)=x(n)}; this is a closed subset of

function of the coordinates x(i) for i ∈ a, and therefore the projection from X
to Γa is a continuous and open surjection. Let x¯ ∈ X¯ be a point P X¯ generic
over V[K]. Use Proposition 3.1.1 to see that whenever a ⊂ n+1 are distinct
numbers then x¯(cid:22)a∈Γ is a sequence Qn-generic over V[K].
Fix i ∈ n. Working in the model V[K][x(i)] find a poset R of cardinality
