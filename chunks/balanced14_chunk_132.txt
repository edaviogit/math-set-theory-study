if necessary, we may assume that {a ,a }∈Γ. Let (cid:126)Γ be a Borel orientation of

Γ with countable outflows, and assume for definiteness that (cid:104)a ,a (cid:105) ∈ (cid:126)Γ. By

For (2), let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair; strengthening τ if necessary we may
assumethatitisaQ-nameforasingleK-set. ReplacingQwithQ×Coll(ω,X)
and strengthening the condition τ if necessary, we may assume that Q (cid:13) ∀x ∈
XV x ∈ τ or there is a ⊂ τ such that {x}∪a ∈/ K. For each point x ∈ X,
either Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ or Q (cid:13) ∃a ⊂ τ ∈ Γ and a ⊂ τ by a balance argument. Let
K
A ⊂ X be the set of all points x ∈ X for which the first option prevails. Then
Q(cid:13)Aˇ=τ∩V and therefore A is a K-set; in view of (1) and Proposition 5.2.4,
it is enough to show that A is a weakly maximal K-set. Let x ∈ X \A and
b⊂X be countable. Observe that Q(cid:13)∃c⊂τ {x}∪c∈/ K; note that for such
set c, (A∩b)∪c is still a K-set. Use the Mostowski absoluteness argument to
find a set c with these properties in the ground model; this confirms that A is
a weakly maximal K-set.
Finally, (3) is obvious. For the last sentence, any condition p ∈ P can
be extended to a maximal K-set, which then represents a balanced condition
stronger than p by (1).
Example 6.3.4. Let g: 2ω → (2ω)ℵ0 be any Borel function. Let K be the
simplicial complex of g-free sets on X = 2ω. It is immediate that K has Borel
coloring number ℵ : the graph Γ consists of all pairs {x ,x } such that either
1 K 0 1
x ∈f(x ) or x ∈f(x ). The Borel orientation of Γ with countable outflows
0 1 1 0 K
can be defined by considering which of the two cases occurs. To consider a case
inwhichtheclassificationofbalancedconditionsisparticularlysimple,suppose
that every point in (2ω)ℵ0 has uncountable preimage. Then, any g-independent
set A ⊂ X is weakly maximal: for every countable set b ⊂ X and every point
x ∈ X \A there is an uncountable set of points y ∈ X such that x ∈ g(y)
and g(y)∩(A∩b)=0, and uncountably many such points y can be found also
(cid:83)
outside of the countable set {g(z): z ∈ A∩b}, making the set (A∩b)∪{y}
free, while (A∩b)∪{y}∪{x} is not.
6.4 Modular complexes
Another class of simplicial complexes in this section is not as closely tied to the
graph Γ . The definition is motivated by concerns of geometric model theory.
