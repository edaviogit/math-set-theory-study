contradiction completes the proof of (1).
For (2), let g: X∗∗ → Y∗∗ be the collection of all pairs (cid:104)c,d(cid:105) ∈ X∗∗×Y∗∗
so that R×Q (cid:13) (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) ∈ τ for some realizations x,y of the virtual classes c,d.
It will be enough to show that g is a total injection from X∗∗ to Y∗∗ and the
pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is equivalent to (cid:104)R,τ (cid:105).
g
To see that dom(g)=X∗∗ and g is an injection, let c∈X∗∗ be an arbitrary
virtual E-class. Use the balance of the pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) to show that there must be
a unique virtual F-class d ∈ Y∗∗ such that R×Q (cid:13) (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) ∈ A˙ for some
gen
realizations x,y of the virtual classes c,d. Use the balance of the pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105)
again to show that for every virtual F-class d ∈ Y∗∗, there either must be a
virtual E-class c ∈ X∗∗ such that R×Q (cid:13) (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) ∈ A˙ for some realizations
gen
x,y of the virtual classes c,d, or it must be the case that R×Q (cid:13) y ∈ τ for
some realization y of the virtual class d.

Finally, (3) is obvious.
Corollary 6.6.4. Let E,F be Borel equivalence relations on respective Polish
spaces X,Y with uncountably many classes. The E,F-collapse poset is balanced
if and only if λ(E)≤λ(F).

ing whose balanced status cannot be decided in ZFC. There are Borel equiva-
lence relations E, F for which the status of the inequality λ(E)≤λ(F) cannot
be decided in ZFC (as can be seen for example from the combination of Corol-
laries 2.5.18 and 2.5.15) and for them the balanced status of the corresponding
collapse forcing is undecidable as well.
Definition 6.6.5. Let E ⊂F be Borel equivalence relations on a Polish space
X. Let K = K be the simplicial complex of all finite sets a ⊂ X such that
E,F

The terminology comes from the examples below; the posets of this type are
used to uniformize various relations in products of quotient spaces. The first
order of business is to classify the balanced conditions. Call a total function

that for each class c represented in the ground model, p contains some point
x∈X which is a realization of the virtual E-class f(c). It is not difficult to see
that the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) is a P-pin.
