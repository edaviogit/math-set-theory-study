282 CHAPTER 11. LOCALLY COUNTABLE STRUCTURES
We turn to the proof of the very Suslin property. By the assumptions, the
set B = {(cid:104)(cid:126)x,y(cid:105) ∈ Xn×X: (cid:126)x is injective and ∀i ∈ n (cid:126)x(i) Γ y} is Borel and all
of its vertical sections are countable by the initial assumption on the graph Γ.
Use the Lusin–Novikov theorem to find Borel functions {f : i∈ω} from Xn to
i
(cid:83)
X such that B ⊂ f .
i i
Now, let C ⊂ K be a countable set. Write supp(C) ⊂ X for the closure
(cid:83)
of the set dom(c) under the functions f for i ∈ ω. We claim that the
c∈C i
following are equivalent:
• C is predense;
• foreveryb∈K withdom(b)⊂supp(C)thereisc∈C suchthatc∪b∈K.
This will show that the collection of (enumerations of) countable predense sub-

description of it.
Now, the first item certainly implies the second. The opposite implication
is the heart of the matter. Suppose that the first item fails, and let a ∈ K be
a condition such that for every c ∈ C c∪a ∈/ K holds. Note that for every
y ∈ dom(a)\supp(C), the set u = {x ∈ supp(C): x Γ y} must have size less
y
than n, otherwise y ∈supp(C) would hold by the initial choice of the functions
(cid:83)
f . Strengthening a if necessary then, we may assume that u ⊂ dom(a).
i y y
Let b=a(cid:22)supp(C) and argue that b witnesses the failure of the second item.
Let c ∈ C be an arbitrary element. Since c is incompatible with a, there
must be either some x ∈ dom(c)∩dom(a) such that c(x) (cid:54)= a(x), or some Γ-
connected x ∈ dom(c) and y ∈ dom(a) such that c(x) = a(y). In the former
case, x ∈ supp(C) and so x ∈ dom(b) witnesses the incompatibility of b,c. In
the latter case, if y ∈ supp(C) then y ∈ dom(b) witnesses the incompatibility
of b,c. If y ∈/ supp(C) then x ∈ dom(b) by the strengthening of a, and then
b(x)(cid:54)=a(y)=c(x) and so x witnesses the incompatibility of b,c again.
Theorem 11.5.4. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X such that there
is no injective homomorphism from K→ to Γ. Then K ordered by reverse
ω,ω Γ
inclusion is a Suslin σ-liminf-centered poset.
Note that we are not asserting that the poset K must be very Suslin in this
Γ
case; we do not know that.
Proof. Foreachnumbern∈ω letA ={a∈K: |dom(a)|<nandrng(a)⊂n}.

(cid:83)
It is clear that each set A is Borel and K = A . Assume that one of the
n n n
sets A is not liminf-centered and work to produce an injective homomorphism
n
from K→ to Γ. This will prove the theorem.
ω,ω
Suppose that {a : i ∈ ω} is a collection of conditions in A such that it is
i n
outright forced by K that a belongs to the generic filter for only finitely many
i
values of i ∈ ω. Let b ∈ K be inclusion-maximal such that b ⊂ a holds for
i
infinitely many i ∈ ω; thinning out the original collection if necessary, we may
assume that b ⊂ a holds for all i ∈ ω. Thinning out even further, we may
i
assume that the sets dom(a \b) for i∈ω are pairwise disjoint.
