Proof. For the direction (1)→(2), assume that the ideal I is ω-hitting. Let
h: ωω → P(ω) be a continuous map such that I = rng(h). Let T = {t ∈
ω<ω: h(cid:48)(cid:48)[t]isω-hitting}. ThesetT ⊂ω<ωisclearlyclosedunderinitialsegment.
Claim 3.2.5. For all t ∈ T there is n ∈ ω such that for all m > n there is
z ∈[T (cid:22)t] such that m∈h(z).
Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that the conclusion fails for some node
t ∈ T. Let a = ω\ (cid:83) h(cid:48)(cid:48)[T (cid:22) t]; the set a ⊂ ω is infinite. For each s ∈ ω<ω \T
let c be a countable collection of infinite subsets of ω such that for all z ∈[s],
s
(cid:83)
h(z) has finite intersection with one element of c . Let c = c ∪{a}; it
s s∈/T s
is not difficult to see that for every z ∈ [t], h(z) has finite intersection with an
element of c, contradicting the assumption that t∈T.
Now, let X be the closed set of all triples (cid:104)y ,y ,z(cid:105) ⊂ 2ω ×2ω ×[T] such

that {n ∈ ω: y (n) (cid:54)= y (n)} ⊂ h(z). Let f ,f : X → 2ω be the projections
0 1 0 1
into the first and second coordinate. It is not difficult to see that both of these
maps are continuous and open. In view of Theorem 3.1.4, the following claim
concludes the proof of (2).
Claim 3.2.6. The maps f ,f are independent.

Proof. Let O ⊂ X be an open set. Find u ,u ∈ 2<ω and t ∈ T such that
0 1
([u ]×[u ]×[t])∩X is a nonempty subset of O. Thinning out further, we may

assumethatthebinarystringsu ,u havethesamelengthandforallz ∈[T (cid:22)t]
0 1
and every l such that u (l)(cid:54)=u (l), n∈h(z) holds. Let n∈ω be such that for
0 1
all m > n there is z ∈ [T (cid:22) t] such that m ∈ h(z). Let v ∈ 2<ω be any binary
string extending u of length > n and A = [v]. We claim that the open set A
0
witnesses the definition of independence for f ,f and O.

Indeed, suppose that w ,w are two binary strings of the same length ex-
0 1
tending v. To produce a walk from [w ] to [w ], list all entries on which the
0 1
strings w ,w differ by {m : j ∈i}. Let y ∈[w ] be any point, and let y ∈2ω
0 1 j 0 j
be the point obtained from y by flipping the outputs at all m for k ∈j. Thus,
k
y differs from y only at entry m and y ∈ [w ]. Let y(cid:48) ∈ 2ω be the point
j j+1 j i 1 j
obtained by replacing the initial segment u ⊂y with u . Also, let z ∈[T (cid:22)t]
0 j 1 j
be any point such that m ∈ h(z ). Now, define points x ,x ∈ X for
j j 2j+1 2j+2
j ∈i as follows:
• x =(cid:104)y ,y(cid:48),z(cid:105) for any z ∈[T (cid:22)t];
0 0 0
• x =(cid:104)y ,y(cid:48) ,z (cid:105);
2j+1 j j+1 j
• x =(cid:104)y ,y(cid:48) ,z(cid:105) for any z ∈[T (cid:22)t].
2j+2 j+1 j+1
Clearly, the sequence (cid:104)x : k ≤2i(cid:105) is a walk from [w ] to [w ] as required.
