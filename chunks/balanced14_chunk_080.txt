(2) follows easily from (1). Let h ,h ,h ⊂ R be any filters obtained from
a b c
(1); we will show that these filters are in fact mutually generic over the model
V. Since Coll(ω,< κ)3 has κ-c.c.c., it is enough to show that for every ordinal
α ∈ κ, the filters hα = h ∩Coll(ω,< α), hα = h ∩Coll(ω,< α), and hα =
a a b b c
h ∩Coll(ω,< α) are mutually generic over V. Since the filters hα, hα and
c a b
hα are coded by reals in the models M[h ], M[h ], and M[h ],there are finite

genericity now follows from the general Corollary 1.7.9 about product forcing.
(3) is proved in several parallel cases depending on the mutual position of
the sets a,b vis-a-vis inclusion. We will treat the case in which all three sets
a ∩ b, a \ b, b \ a are nonempty. Suppose for contradiction that P × P (cid:13)

P˙ ×P˙ (cid:13) τ E τ . Then, the quadruple product Coll(ω,< κ)4
{0,1} {1,2} {0,1} {1,2}
forces in V that P˙ ×P˙ ×P˙ (cid:13)τ E τ E τ , in particular

P˙ ×P˙ (cid:13)τ ×τ . Inviewof(2)again,thismeansthattheproduct

First, assume that y ,y ∈ Y are F -related. Then rng(y ) = rng(y ),

rng(g(y ))=rng(g(y )), and so M =M , P =P and τ =τ . Let H ⊂
