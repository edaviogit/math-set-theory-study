The concentration of measure computations in [73, Theorem 4.3.19] show that
such a fast sequence of intervals indeed exists. Now, let T be the tree of all
ini
finite sequences t such that for each n ∈ dom(t), t(n) ∈ 2Jn. Let Q be the
partial order of all nonempty trees q ⊂ T without endnodes such that for
ini
each m ∈ ω there is n ∈ ω such that for each t ∈ q of length n > n , the
m m
set {x ∈ 2Jn: t(cid:97)(cid:104)x(cid:105) ∈ q} has µ
n
-mass ≥ m/n. The ordering on Q is that of
inclusion. Let x˙ be the Q-name for the concatenation of the trunks of the
gen
trees in the generic filter. We must show that items (I) and (II) above hold for
Q and x˙ .
gen
Item (I) is where the concentration of measure shows up in force. We will
in fact show that whenever q ,q ∈ Q are arbitrary conditions then there are
0 1
conditions q(cid:48) ≤ q ,q(cid:48) ≤ q and an isomorphism π: Q (cid:22) q(cid:48) → Q (cid:22) q(cid:48) such that

π(1−x˙ ) is forced by q(cid:48) to be modulo I equivalent to x˙ . To see this, let

Write q(cid:48) =π(cid:48)(cid:48)q(cid:48). Since the measures µ are normalized counting measures, the
1 0 n
map π naturally extends to an isomorphism π: Q (cid:22) q(cid:48) → Q (cid:22) q(cid:48). The demand

(IV) then implies that π(1−x˙ ) is forced by q(cid:48) to be modulo I equivalent to

x˙ as required.

The map π is obtained by a hungry algorithm. Among all level and order
preserving injections from subsets of q (cid:22) t to q (cid:22) t which satisfy (IV), se-

q(cid:48) = dom(π) belongs to Q. To see this, first of all q(cid:48) is closed under initial

segment by an obvious maximality argument. To verify the branching condi-
tion in the definition of Q for q(cid:48), let t ∈ q(cid:48) of length some n ≥ |t |. It will
