ect matching and B ⊂K is a Borel set. To
verify Definition 6.4.2 for A,B, let M be a countable elementary submodel of a
large structure containing G,A,B. If the third option of Definition 6.4.2 fails,

there must be b∈B such that (M ∩A)∪b is a matching. Let b(cid:48) =b∩M and

are several possibilities now. If a = b = b(cid:48) then a∪A is a matching by the
elementarity of M, and by the maximality of A, a ⊂ A and the option (2) has
beenverified. Ifa(cid:54)=banda∪bisamatching,thenoption(1)follows. Otherwise,
there has to be an edge e ∈b connecting some vertex x mentioned in a with a

vertex outside of M. Since A is a perfect matching and M is elementary, there

be the case that e (cid:54)= e and so (M ∩A)∪b is not a matching, contradicting

the choice of the set b.
Not every modular simplicial complex needs to be a matroid.
Example 6.4.12. Let X be a Polish space and let Γ be a Borel collection
of finite subsets of X. Let K be the simplicial complex on Γ consisting of
finite subsets of Γ which consist of pairwise disjoint sets. It is immediate that
(cid:83)
the simplicial complex K is modular, with the modular function f(a) = a.
The simplicial complex K is typically not a matroid: for example, if there are
points x ,x which are together contained in a single element of Γ and are also
0 1
contained in respective disjoint elements of Γ, then the definitory property of a
matroid immediately fails.
Finally,wepresentseveralexamplesofsimplicialcomplexeswhicharenotmod-
ular. To rule out the existence of a function with the modular property, we use
the following simple criterion:
(*) there are pairwise disjoint sets {a,b : α ∈ ω } in K such that for any
α 1
α,β ∈ω b ∪b ∈K holds and for every α∈ω , a∪b ∈/ K holds.

contains s,t,x,y and therefore has transcendence degree 4. To recover s,t,x,y
from b ∪b , write w = x−y and z = xy−1; both clearly belong to Q(b ,b ).

Then the recovery follows from the string of equalities y =w(z−1)−1, x=zy,
t=(xt)x−1 and s=(x+s)−x. (This elegant argument was pointed out to us
by Peter Sin.)
