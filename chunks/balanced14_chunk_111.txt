112 CHAPTER 4. NESTED SEQUENCES OF MODELS
The main feature of choice-coherent sequences of models we use later is the
following theorem connecting them with orbit equivalence relations:
Theorem 4.3.6. Let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a generic choice-coherent sequence of
n
models. Let E be an orbit equivalence relation on a Polish space X with code in
(cid:84)
M = M . If a virtual E-class is represented in M for every n ∈ ω, then
ω n n n
it is represented in M .

NotethatavirtualE-classisanequivalenceclassofE-pins. Thus,thetheorem
says that if there are pairwise equivalent E-pins (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105) ∈ M for all n ∈ ω,
n n n
then there is an E-pin equivalent to them in the intersection model.
Proof. Let Γ be a Polish group continuously acting on the space X, inducing
the equivalence relation E. Let d be a compatible right-invariant metric on Γ.
Let (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105) ∈ M be an E-pin which has an equivalent in the model M for
0 0 0 n
every n ∈ ω. Let λ be a cardinal so large that for each n ∈ ω, M is a generic
0
extension of M by a poset of size < λ, and M contains an E-pin on a poset
n n
of size <λ equivalent to the pin (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105).

Let P be Cohen forcing on the Polish group Γ, with its name γ˙ for the

generic point. Let γ ∈ Γ be a Cohen-generic point, H ⊂ P be a generic filter

In the model M [γ,H,K], form the model N as the class of all sets hereditarily

definable from γ ·x and parameters in M . The model N is an intermediate
0 ω
model of ZFC between M and M [γ,H], so by Fact 1.7.6, the model N is a

forcingextensionofM . WewillarguethatN andM [H]aremutuallygeneric

First note that this will prove the theorem. Let Q,τ ∈M be a poset and a
ω
nameandL⊂QbeafiltergenericoverthemodelM [H]suchthatM [L]=N
0 ω
and τ/L = γ ·x . By the forcing theorem in the model M , there have to be
0 0
conditions p∈H and q ∈L such that (cid:104)p,q(cid:105)(cid:13)τ E τ. It is immediate that τ as
0
a name on Q(cid:22)q is E-pinned, and the E-pin (cid:104)Q(cid:22)q,τ(cid:105) is equivalent to (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105).

This confirms the conclusion of the theorem.
To argue that N and M [H] are mutually generic extensions of M , we use
0 ω
the criterion of Proposition 1.7.8. In other words, if a ∈ M [H] and b ∈ N are
0
disjoint subsets of some ordinal κ, we must find a set c ∈ M of ordinals such

that O ⊂ Γ is a nonempty open set, p ∈ P is a condition, a˙ is a P -name for

a set of ordinals, and φ is a formula with parameters in M such that in the

Finally, we are in a position to use some coherence arguments. Let ≺ be a

A typical construction of a coherent sequence (in the sense of Definition 4.2.1)
proceeds by induction on n ∈ ω. If (cid:104)v : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is coherent, w ∈ M , and φ is

some formula with parameters in M , one can select the ≺-least w ∈M
