Proof. Let α ∈ κ and p ∈ P; we must produce q ≤ p such that α ∈ dom(q).
Enumerate dom(p) as β for i ∈ k and write α = β . Use the genericity of the
i k
function ν to find numbers m < m < m < ...m and pairwise distinct

Now, if G ⊂ P is a generic filter, then in V[G] let π: κ → P(ω) be defined
(cid:83)
by π(α) = p(α). The claims show that f = ν◦g◦π, in particular π is a
p∈G
homomorphism of ¬T to ¬R.
Example 2.5.38. Let X be a Polish space and R a combinatorially universal
equivalence relation on [X]<ℵ0 with countably many classes. Let n > 0 be
a number. Let G be the Borel hypergraph on X consisting of all finite sets

2. if Martin’s Axiom for ℵ holds, then the equality is attained.
n
Proof. Fix the number n. The computations depend on and are motivated
by the following results of Komj´ath and Shelah [60]. Let κ = ℵ . For every
n
equivalence relation T on [κ]<ℵ0 with countably many classes, there is a finite
seta⊂κwhichcanbewritteninatleast2n−1waysasaunionoftwodistinct
T-related sets. In addition, if Martin’s Axiom for κ holds then there is an
equivalence relation T on [κ]<ℵ0 with countably many classes such that every
finite set a⊂κ can be written in at most 2n−1 ways as a union of two distinct
T-related sets.
For (1), the first part of this result shows that there is no G -anticlique of
n
size κ+. For (2), use Martin’s Axiom and the second part of the Komj´ath–
Shelah result to find the equivalence relation T on [κ]<ℵ0 with countably many
classes as above, and use the universality of the relation R to find an injective
homomorphism π: κ → X of ¬T to ¬R. It is immediate that rng(π) ⊂ X is
a G -anticlique of size κ. Proposition 2.5.27 then implies that κ(E ) ≥ κ+ =
n Gn
ℵ .

Much more complicated effects can be realized if the hypergraph G is allowed
to have infinite edges. We conclude this section with an example of this type.
