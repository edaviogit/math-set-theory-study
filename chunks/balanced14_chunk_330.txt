p (cid:13) τ ⊂ X. We must find a Borel set B and a stronger condition p¯≤ p in P
such that p¯(cid:13)τ∆B˙ ∈I.
The condition p ∈ P and the name τ are definable from a real parameter
z ∈2ω andsomeparametersinthegroundmodel. LetV[K]beanintermediate
extension using a poset of size < κ such that z ∈ V[K] and work in the model
V[K]. Since P is Q-balanced in V[K], it must be the case that there is a
weakly balanced condition p¯ ≤ p such that Q (cid:13) p¯ is weakly balanced. By
a balance argument, Q (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p¯ decides the statement x˙ ∈ τ.

p¯xˇ ∈ τ, and then by the forcing theorem in V[K][g], W |= p¯ (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ. By a
similar reasoning, it must be the case that τ \B ⊂ C where C = {x ∈ X:
for no filter g ⊂ QV[K] generic over V[K], x˙ /g = x}. However, it is clear

that C ∈I holds: if there were a condition q ∈Q forcing x˙ ∈B, taking any

filter G⊂Q generic over W containing the condition q, the point x˙ /G must

belongtoC. However,sincetheposetQisc.c.c. andSuslin,thefilterG∩V[K]

its associated name for the generic real. It is clear that the associated ideal I
is just the ideal of Lebesgue null sets. Now, the balanced conditions for P have
been classified in Theorem 8.8.2. Let p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) be a condition. Then the
p p
(collapse name for the) pair p¯ = (cid:104)a ,c(cid:105) is a balanced condition whenever c is
p
a dominating set of functions in ωω in the ground model. Now, the poset Q
is bounding, therefore the set b remains dominating in the Q-extension and p¯
p
is a balanced condition in the Q-extension as well. By Theorem 14.3.4, in the
P-extension of the Solovay model, every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable.
In that extension, there must be a set of reals without the Baire property by
Theorem 14.3.1; in fact, the generic set must fail to have the Baire property.
