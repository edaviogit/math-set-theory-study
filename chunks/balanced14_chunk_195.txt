sequence of pairwise distinct reals, while ZF+DC+φ +φ implies ¬ψ. The fol-

Example 9.1.7. Let φ be the statement “there is an uncountable sequence
0
of E -classes” and let φ be the statement “there is an E -transversal”. The
0 1 0
conjunction ψ∧φ holds in the abovementioned weakly balanced extension of
0
the Solovay model. The conjunction ψ∧φ holds in the balanced extension of

the Solovay model adding an E -transversal with countable approximations by

Corollary9.1.2. Finally, theconjunctionφ ∧φ immediatelyimplies¬ψ inZF.

the symmetric Solovay model contains an acyclic decomposition of 2ω while it

the collapse poset of E to 2ω of Definition 6.6.2. Since the virtual E-classes are
classified by subsets of 2ω linearly ordered by Turing reducibility and each such
set can have size at most ℵ

Now, argue in the theory ZF+DC+φ +φ . Let c: [2ω]2 → ω be an acyclic
0 1
decomposition, and let f be an injection from the E-quotient space to 2ω. Let
M be the model of sets hereditarily ordinally definable from the parameters
c,f. As is well-known, M is a model of ZFC. Since c (cid:22) M ∈ M is an acyclic
decomposition in M, by Proposition ?? M satisfies CH. The argument will be
complete if we show that 2ω ⊂M.
We first show that M contains uncountably many reals. Suppose towards
contradictionthatthisfails. WorkinginM,writeκ=ωM andfindanuncount-

able sequence (cid:104)x : α ∈ κ(cid:105) of elements of 2ω which is increasing in the Turing
α
reducibility order. Consider the injective map g: P(κ)∩M → 2ω defined by
g(b)=f({x : α∈b}); note that the definition is enabled by the initial contra-
α
dictory assumption. The map g is definable, therefore belongs to M and in M,
it witnesses 2ℵ1 ≤2ℵ0, in contradiction with the Continuum Hypothesis.
Now, we are ready to show that 2ω ⊂ M. Suppose that x ∈ 2ω is a point.
Since M contains uncountably many elements of 2ω, there must be distinct
