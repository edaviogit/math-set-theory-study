x on a Polish space X.
A K-set A⊂X is weakly maximal if for every point x∈X either x∈A or for
every countable set b⊂X there is c∈K disjoint from b such that (A∩b)∪c is
a K-set, but (A∩b)∪c∪{x} is not.

In particular, every maximal K-set is weakly maximal. For a weakly maximal
set A⊂X, let τ be the Coll(ω,X)-name for the analytic set of all p∈P such
A
that for all x ∈ X ∩V, if x ∈ A then x ∈ p and if x ∈/ A then p∪{x} is not a
K-set. In particular, if A is a maximal K-set, then Coll(ω,X)(cid:13)Στ =Aˇ.

Theorem 6.3.3. Let K be a Borel simplicial complex on a Polish space X of
Borel coloring number ℵ .

1. For every weakly maximal K-set A ⊂ X, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) is bal-
A
anced in the poset P =P ;
K
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105), there is a weakly maximal K-set A ⊂ X
such that the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
A
3. distinct weakly maximal K-sets yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Proof. For (1), we must first show that Coll(ω,X) (cid:13) τ (cid:54)= 0. By a Mostowski

absoluteness argument, it is just enough to produce some generic extension in
which there is a K-set p ⊂ X such that for all x ∈ X ∩ V, if x ∈ A then
x ∈ p and if x ∈/ A then p ∪ {x} is not a K-set. To do this, let Q be the
poset of nonstationary subsets of [X]ℵ0 and let j: V → M be the Q-name
for the associated generic ultrapower. In particular, M is an ω-model of ZFC
containing j(cid:48)(cid:48)X as an element, represented by the identity function; this set
is forced to be countable in M. Now, consider a product of copies Q of Q
x
indexed by elements x ∈ X \A, with mutually generic filters G ⊂ Q and
x x
in the model V[G : x ∈ X \A] consider the generic ultrapower embeddings
x
j : V → M . By the weak maximality of A and elementarity, there is a set
x x
c ∈ M disjoint from V such that A ∪ c is a K-set, and A ∪ c ∪ {x} is
x x x x
(cid:83)
not. We claim that p = A∪ c is a K-set; this will complete the proof.

Suppose towards a contradiction that this is not the case, and find finite sets
(cid:83)
a ⊂ A and a ⊂ c for x in some finite index set I such that a∪ a ∈/ K
x x x x
and a are inclusion-minimal possible. Pick x be any element of I such that

(cid:83)
a (cid:54)= 0, let b = a , and let c = a∪ a . It is clear that {c,d} ∈ Γ.

Let (cid:126)Γ be a Borel orientation of Γ with countable outflows, and assume for
definiteness that (cid:104)c,b(cid:105) ∈ (cid:126)Γ. By a Mostowski absoluteness argument between
V[G : x (cid:54)= x ] and V[G : x ∈ X \A], it must be the case that b, as much as
x 0 x
all other points of the countable (cid:126)Γ-outflow of c, belongs to V[G : x (cid:54)= x ], so
x 0
b∈V[G : x(cid:54)=x ]∩V[G ]=V. This contradicts the initial choice of the sets

Now, for the balance part, suppose that V[H ] and V[H ] are mutually

generic extensions of V, and p ∈ V[H ] and p ∈ V[H ] are conditions such

that for all x ∈ X ∩V, if x ∈ A then x ∈ p and if x ∈/ A then p ∪{x} is not

a K-set, and similarly for p . We must show that p ∪p is a K-set. Suppose
