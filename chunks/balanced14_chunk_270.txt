assume that b ⊂ a holds for all i ∈ ω. Thinning out even further, we may

assume that the sets dom(a \b) for i∈ω are pairwise disjoint.

j i
This is possible by the initial assumptions on the collection {a : i ∈ ω}. Note
i
that the first and third item imply that for a given j ∈ ω, for all but finitely
many numbers i ∈ ω there are elements x ∈ dom(c ) and y ∈ dom(a \b) such
j i
that x Γ y and c (x) = a (y) both hold. In addition, the point x ∈ X cannot

Now, let ≺ be any linear ordering of the space X. For numbers j,t write

j j j j j j
belongs to the ultrafilter U. Also, there is a set d⊂ω in U and a number s∈ω
such that for all j ∈ d, s = s holds. Now by recursion on k ∈ ω define an

increasing sequence of numbers j so that j ∈d∩ a . Finally, define the

map π: 2×ω →X by π(0,k)=x(j ,t ) and π(1,k)=y(j ,s). It is not

Theorem 11.5.5. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X containing no
injective homomorphic image of K for some number n ∈ ω. Then the poset

K is Suslin σ-Ramsey-centered.

enough to prove that each number m∈ω, the set A ⊂K is Ramsey-centered.
m
Let k ∈ ω be an arbitrary number greater than 2n. We have to find l ∈ ω
such that every set {c : i∈l}⊂A contains a subset of size k with a common
i m
lower bound. We will show that any number l such that l → (k)2 works.

To see this, let {c : i ∈ l} ⊂ A be a set. Let ≺ be any linear ordering of
i m
the space X, for each i,u ∈ ω write c for the u-th element of dom(c ) in the
iu i
ordering ≺ if it exists, and define a partition π: [l]2 → (m×m×2)∪{∞} by
requiring the following. If i ∈ j ∈ l and π(i,j) = (cid:104)u,v,0(cid:105) then c = c and
iu jv
c (c ) (cid:54)= c (c ); if π(i,j) = (cid:104)u,v,1 then c Γ c and c (c ) = c (c ); and if
i iu j jv iu jv i iu j jv
π(i,j)=∞ then no u,v as in the previous items can be found.
Use the Ramsey property of the number l to find a set a⊂l of size k which
is homogeneous for the partition π. It is enough to argue that the set {c : i ∈
i
a} has a common lower bound. To see this, inquire about the homogeneous
partition value achieved. It cannot be of the form (cid:104)u,v,0(cid:105) because then the
coloring c has irreconcilable candidates for the value of c (c ), where i is the
i i iu
second number in the set a. The homogeneous partition value cannot be of
the form (cid:104)u,v,1(cid:105) since then the points c where i ranges over the first n many
iu
elements of a, and c where j ranges over the second n-many elements of a,
