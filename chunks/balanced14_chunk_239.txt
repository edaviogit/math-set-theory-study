model, countable-to-one uniformization fails.
Proof. For simplicity of notation, assume that X =2ω. Let W[F] be the sym-
metric Solovay model derived from an inaccessible cardinal κ, with the generic

Kurepa family F attached. In W[F], let E be the equivalence relation on X
connecting x,y if there is no set in F containing x but not y or vice versa. All
classes of the equivalence relation E are countable as the family F consists of
countable sets and is cofinal. We will show that in W[F] there is no total func-
tionf: X →X suchthatforeveryx∈X, if[x] (cid:54)={x}thenf(x)∈[x] \{x}.

This is clearly in violation of countable-to-one uniformization.
Working in W, let p ∈ P be a condition and τ be a P-name such that
p (cid:13) τ: X → X is a function. We must find x ∈ X and a stronger condition
p¯≤p which forces that [x] (cid:54)={x} and τ(x)∈/ [x] \{x}. The condition p and
E E
the name τ are definable from some parameter z ∈2ω and some ground model
parameters. Let V[K] be an intermediate model obtained by a forcing of size
<κ which contains the parameter z. Work in the model V[K].
Let Q be the Cohen forcing on X, adding the generic point x˙ . Let
gen
H ,H ⊂ Q be mutually generic filters, let x = x˙ /H and x = x˙ /H ,
0 1 0 gen 0 1 gen 1
and in the model V[K][H ][H ] consider the virtual condition p¯≤ p which in

Theorem 8.4.3, p¯ is a balanced virtual condition. By a balance argument, it
decides the value of τ(x ) to be some specific point y ∈ X. An inspection of

. We will be finished
if we show that y is not E -related to x .

Towards contradiction, assume that it is. Then y is a Cohen generic point
over V[K][H ], yielding the same extension as x . By the forcing theorem in

V[K][H ] and the definability of τ, there would have to be a condition q ∈ Q

such that V[K][H ] |= q (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p¯ (cid:13) τ(xˇ ) = x˙ . By the forcing

theorem again, in the model V[K][H ][H ], the virtual condition p¯would force
