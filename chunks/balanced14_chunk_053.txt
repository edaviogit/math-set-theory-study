the set B is nonempty already in V[G] by the Mostowski absoluteness between
V[G] and V[G][H]. Back in V, let σ be any Coll(ω,(cid:105) )-name for an element of
α
the set B. This clearly works.

relations on ω which are extensional and wellfounded of rank < α; let E be
α
the isomorphism relation. It is not difficult to check (Theorem 2.4.5) that for
each countable ordinal α, the relation E is Borel, and its pinned names are
α
collapse names for isomorphs of the membership relation on sets in V . Thus,
α
the cardinals κ(E ) converge to (cid:105) .

Theorem 2.5.8. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation almost reducible to
an orbit equivalence relation of a continuous Polish group action. If κ(E)<∞
then κ(E) is not greater than the first ω -Erd˝os cardinal.

Proof. Let κ be the first ω -Erd˝os cardinal, and suppose that κ(E) > κ; we

must show that κ(E) = ∞. Since the cardinal κ is the Hanf number for the
class of wellfounded models of first order sentences, for every cardinal λ there
is a wellfounded model M such that M |= κ(E) > λ. Now, since E is almost
reducible to an orbit equivalence relation, Corollary 2.7.4 shows that the well-
founded model M is correct about κ(E) to the extent that |κ(E)M|≤κ(E). It
follows that κ(E)>λ, and since λ was arbitrary, κ(E)=∞.
Example 2.5.9. For every countable ordinal α there is a coanalytic class Γ of
structures on ω, invariant under isomorphism, such that κ(E ) is equal to the
Γ
first α-Erd˝os cardinal.
Proof. Let Γ be the class of all binary relations on ω which are extensional,
wellfounded, and do not admit a sequence of indiscernibles of ordertype α; we
claim that this class works.

Write E for E and κ for the first α-Erd˝os cardinal. By Theorem 2.4.5, every
Γ
virtual E-class is represented by a transitive set A without indiscernibles of
ordertype α. It must be the case that |A|<κ so κ(E)≤κ. On the other hand,

Theorem 2.5.10. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. If κ(E)<∞ then κ(E)<κ.
Proof. Suppose that there is a poset P and an E-pinned name τ on P which is
not E¯-related to any name on a poset of size < κ. We will produce a proper
class of pairwise non-E¯-related E-pinned names.
First note that the poset P and the name τ can be selected so that |P|=κ.
