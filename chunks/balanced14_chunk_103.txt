3.6. A VARIATION FOR MEASURE 103
Example 3.6.15. There is a Tsirelson-type [27] ideal I on ω and a Borel
homomorphism h: B → 2ω of = to E such that preimages of E -equivalence
I 0 0
classes are µ-null.
Proof. We will deal with a certain special kind of Tsirelson submeasures. Let
α > 0 be a real number and f: ω → R+ be a nonincreasing function con-
verging to 0. By induction on n ∈ ω define submeasures ν on ω by setting

0 1 j
j < min(b ) ≤ max(b ) < min(b ) ≤ max(b ) < .... In the end, let the sub-

measure ν be the supremum of ν for n∈ω. Some computations are necessary
n
to verify that ν is really a lower semicontinuous submeasure on ω [27]. The
Tsirelson ideal I = {a ⊂ ω: lim ν(a\m) = 0} turns out to be an F P-ideal
m σ
[27].

y(m)} has size at least i/α. This is easily possible by Claim 3.6.14. Now,
consider the function f defined by f(m) = 1/i for m ∈ (max(I ),max(I )]

and let ν be the derived submeasure and I the derived Tsirelson ideal. Observe

the set {m ∈ I : x(m) (cid:54)= y(m)} has ν-mass at least 1, since it has ν -mass at

least 1. The rest of the proof follows the lines of Example 3.6.13.
Example 3.6.16. Let J be the Rado graph ideal on ω. There is a Borel
homomorphism h: 2ω → 2ω from = to E such that preimages of E -classes
J 0 0
are µ-null.
Proof. Let G be the Rado graph, interpreted so that ω is the set of its vertices;
then J is the ideal on ω generated by J-cliques and J-anticliques. To construct
h, by induction on n ∈ ω find pairwise disjoint finite sets I ⊂ ω and sets

least n;
• the sets a

⊂2In have the same relative size larger than 1/2−2−n.
This is easy to do using the universality properties of the Rado graph and
Claim 3.6.14 repeatedly. Let B = {x ∈ 2ω: ∀∞n x (cid:22) I ∈ a ∪ b } and

let h : B → 2ω be the Borel map defined by h (x) = 0 ↔ x (cid:22) I ∈ a . It is

104 CHAPTER 3. TURBULENCE
There are numerous questions left open by the development of this section, of
which we quote two.
Question 3.6.17. Can the assumption that d be an ultrametric be eliminated
from the assumptions of Theorem 3.6.2?
Question3.6.18. IsthereaTsirelsonidealwhosenaturalactionon2ω exhibits
