a generic filter, the symbol τ/G denotes the valuation of the name τ according
to the filter G. Every Polish space X and every analytic set A ⊂ X have a
canonical interpretation in every generic extension, which commutes with all
usual descriptive set theoretic operations on Polish spaces. For the detailed
theory of interpretations, see [102]; we will use it without explicit mention as is
customary in the current forcing practice. The interpretations obey two basic
absoluteness rules:
Fact 1.7.4. (Mostowski absoluteness) If M ⊂ N are transitive models of
ZF+DC and φ(p(cid:126)) is a Σ1-formula with parameters in M, then M |= φ(p(cid:126)) if
1
and only if N |=φ(ip(cid:126)) where i is the interpretation operation.
Fact1.7.5. (Shoenfieldabsoluteness)IfM ⊂N aretransitivemodelsofZF+DC
such that ω ⊂M holds, and φ(p(cid:126)) is a Π1-formula with parameters in M, then

M |=φ(p(cid:126)) if and only if N |=φ(ip(cid:126)) where i is the interpretation operation.
In particular, intepretations of analytic equivalence relations are equivalence
relationsagain,andinterpretationsofPolishgroupsandcontinuousPolishgroup
actions on Polish spaces are Polish groups and continuous Polish group actions
again. Mutual relationships between forcing extensions of ZFC are captured in
the following facts:
Fact 1.7.6. If V is a model of ZFC, V[G] is a forcing extension of V, and M
is a model of ZFC such that V ⊂ M ⊂ V[G], then M is a forcing extension of
V and V[G] is a forcing extension of M.
The book is loaded with product forcing notions. This section provides basic
information on products.
Fact 1.7.7. [45,Lemma15.9]LetP,Qbeposetsandinsomegenericextension,
let G ⊂ P,H ⊂ Q be filters separately generic over the ground model. The
following are equivalent:
1. G×H ⊂P ×Q is a filter generic over the ground model;
2. G⊂P is generic over the model V[H].
In the affirmative case, V[G]∩V[H]=V.
If G×H ⊂ P ×Q is a filter generic over the ground model, we say that the
filters G,H (or their generic extensions) are mutually generic.

uct forcing. It says that mutual genericity of forcing extensions can be char-
acterized without an appeal to the specific generic filters and posets that were
used to obtain the extensions, and indeed without any appeal to forcing at all.
Proposition 1.7.8. Let n ∈ ω be a number and {P : i ∈ n} be posets. Let
i
{G : i ∈ n} be filters separately generic over the ground model V over the
i
respective posets. The following are equivalent:
