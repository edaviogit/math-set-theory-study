232 CHAPTER 9. PRESERVING CARDINALITIES
Now, towards the proof of the theorem. Write E = Eœâ and F = E . Let
0 KœÉ
Œ∫ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin forcing which is compactly
balanced and pod balanced below Œ∫. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model
derived from Œ∫ and work in the model W. Let p‚ààP be a condition and œÑ be a
P-name such that p forces œÑ to be a function from the E-quotient space to the
F-quotient space. We must find a condition q ‚â§p and distinct E-classes which
are forced by q to have the same œÑ-image.
The condition p and the name œÑ must be definable from a parameter z ‚àà2œâ

Q √óQ ; in particular, U is an ultrafilter on œâ, and (cid:104)x : n ‚àà œâ(cid:105) is a sequence

of points in 2œâ. Since the poset Q is œÉ-closed, the models V[K] and V[K][U]

compute the poset Q in the same way, in particular V[K][U][x : n ‚àà œâ] is a

Since (Fact 9.5.5) the poset Q adds no independent reals, a density argument

Let A ‚äÇ œâ√ó2œâ be the relation consisting of all pairs (cid:104)n,x(cid:105) such that x is
E -related to x . In the model V[K][U][x : n ‚àà œâ] form the models V of all
0 n n n
sets hereditarily definable from parameters x for m ‚àà n, A, and parameters
m
in the model V[K][U], and let M be the model of all sets hereditarily definable
from the set A and its elements and some other parameters in V[K][U]. Note
that by VopÀáenka‚Äôs theorem [45, page 249], the sequence (cid:104)x : n ‚àà œâ(cid:105) is generic
n
over the model M and the forcing adding it restores the axiom of choice in its
generic extension of M.
Thefollowingclaimmakesacriticaluseofthecompactbalanceassumption.
Claim 9.5.7. In the model M:
1. thereisasequence (cid:104)p¬Ø : n‚ààœâ(cid:105) suchthat p¬Ø isabalancedvirtualcondition
n n
for V , and p‚â•p¬Ø ‚â•p¬Ø ‚â•p¬Ø ‚â•...;
n 0 1 2
2. any sequence as in (1) must have a lower bound.
Proof. Start with item (1). Working in V[K][U], fix R -names œá so that R
n n n
is the product of the first n-many copies of the Vitali forcing in the product
Q and œá is a name for a virtual balanced condition stronger than p and
1 n
than all œá for m ‚àà n. This is possible by Definition 9.2.1(2). Now, in the
m
model V[K][U][x : n‚ààœâ] for each n‚ààœâ let p¬Ø be the U-limit of the sequence
n n
(cid:104)œá /(cid:104)xi : m ‚àà n(cid:105): i ‚àà œâ(cid:105) in the compact space of virtual balanced conditions
n m
in the model V , where xi ‚àà 2œâ is the binary sequence obtained from x by
n m m
replacing its first i many entries with 0. The limit exists since U generates an
ultrafilter in all models V . The balanced virtual conditions p¬Ø for n‚ààœâ form
n n
a decreasing sequence by Definition 9.2.1(3). Also, the definition of the limit
