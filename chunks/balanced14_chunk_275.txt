288 CHAPTER 11. LOCALLY COUNTABLE STRUCTURES
Theorem 11.6.1. Let E be a pinned Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. Suppose that G is an analytic finitary hypergraph on a Polish space
Y which does not have Borel σ-bounded fractional chromatic number. In the
P -extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of G is uncountable.

Proof. In view of Fact 11.1.22 it is enough to consider the case of a large mea-
sured skew product G. Find a sequence (cid:104)a ,H ,t : n∈ω(cid:105) which generates G

as in Definition 11.1.21. Thus, Y = a and G= H ,t .

Proof. It is clear that Q is very Suslin. To check the very Suslin property of Q,
suppose that a ⊂ Q is a countable set. It is not difficult to see that if there is
a condition r ∈Q incompatible with all elements of a, then there is one whose
(cid:83)
support is a subset of supp(q). The search for an incompatible condition
q∈a
among the countably many conditions of this type is a Borel procedure.
To verify the Suslin measured property of Q, consider the function m: Q→
(0,1] defined by m(q) = 2−n2−k where n ∈ ω is such that rng(q) ⊂ 2n, and
k ∈ ω is such that dom(q) has nonempty intersection with exactly k many E-
classes. For each positive rational number ε > 0 let A = {q ∈ Q: m(q) > ε}.

Since the sets A ⊂ Q are all analytic and Q = A , it is enough to show,
ε ε ε
given ε > 0 and a finite sequence (cid:104)q : i ∈ j(cid:105) of elements of the set A , there is
i ε
a set b ⊂ j of size greater than εj such that the conditions p for i ∈ b have a
i
common lower bound.
To this end, let a be the set of all E-classes with nonempty intersection
with (cid:83) dom(q ). Let µ be the usual probability measure on 2ω and let λ be
i i
the product measure on Y = (2ω)a. Define the set B ⊂ j ×Y as the set of
all pairs (cid:104)i,y(cid:105) such that ∀x ∈ dom(q ) q (x) ⊂ y([x] ). By the definition of
i i E
the function m, the vertical sections B have λ-mass > ε each. By the Fubini
i
theorem applied to the counting measure on j and λ, there must be a point
y ∈ Y such that the horizontal section By has size greater than εj. It is easy
to check that the set {q : i∈By} has a common lower bound in Q.
i
Note that a generic filter G ⊂ Q induces a function defined by f(x) =
(cid:83)
{p(x): p ∈ G} whenever x ∈ X is a ground model point. It is clear that
dom(f) consists of the ground model elements of X, for all such points x ,x ∈
0 1
X x E x iff f(x ) = f(x ) holds, and moreover the range of f consist of
0 1 0 1
elements of 2ω which are not in the ground model.
Now, suppose that p∈P is a condition. Consider the poset R which is the
finite support iteration of the posets Q of length ω . Let f˙ : X → 2ω be the
