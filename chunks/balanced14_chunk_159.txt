p(m)·p(k) ∈ A. There must be also some k ∈ ω such that for
0
all k ≥ k , p(k) ∈ C . Then p(m )·p(k ) should belong simultaneously to
0 p(m0) 0 0
A and to the complement of A, which is a contradiction.

166 CHAPTER 7. ULTRAFILTER FORCINGS
Finally, the statement of the classification theorem for the balanced virtual
conditions in the poset P is at hand.
Γ
Definition 7.4.6. Whenever (cid:104)Γ,·(cid:105) is a countable semigroup and U is an ultra-
filter on Γ, let τ denote the Coll(ω,P(Γ))-name for the (nonempty analytic)
U
set of all conditions diagonalizing U.
Theorem 7.4.7. Let (cid:104)Γ,·(cid:105) be a countable semigroup.
1. Whenever U is an idempotent ultrafilter then (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(Γ)),τ (cid:105) is a bal-
U
anced virtual condition;
2. every balanced pair is equivalent to (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(Γ)),τ (cid:105) for some idempo-
U
tent ultrafilter U;
3. distinct idempotent ultrafilters give rise to inequivalent balanced virtual
conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Γ
Proof. For (1), note that by Proposition 7.4.5, τ is a name for a nonempty set
U
jsut in case U is an idempotent ultrafilter. (1) then follows immediately from
the following claim:
Claim 7.4.8. Let U be an ultrafilter on Γ and (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105), (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105) are posets and

are compatible in P .
Γ
Proof. Let q ∈Q and q ∈Q be conditions and n∈ω be a natural number.

We must find an element γ ∈ Γ and conditions q(cid:48) ≤ q and q(cid:48) ≤ q and finite

nonempty sets a ,a ⊂ ω with minimum larger than n such that q(cid:48) (cid:13) γˇ =

Π τ (m) and q(cid:48) (cid:13) γˇ = Π τ (m). The compatibility of τ ,τ is then

granted by a genericity argument.
Let A ⊂ Γ be the set of all γ ∈ Γ such that there exists a finite nonempty

set a ⊂ ω with minimum greater than n and a condition q(cid:48) ≤ q in Q forcing

γˇ = Π τ (m). Since τ is forced to diagonalize U, it must be the case that
m∈a 0 0
A ∈ U. Similarly, let A ⊂ Γ be the set of all γ ∈ Γ such that there exists a

in Q forcing γˇ = Π τ (m). Since τ is forced to diagonalize U, it must be

the case that A ∈U. Choose γ ∈A ∩A and choose q(cid:48) ≤q , q(cid:48) ≤q and sets

a ,a witnessing the membership of γ in A ,A . This completes the proof.

For (2), suppose that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair. Without loss of generality
we may assume that Q collapses the size of P(Γ)∩V to ℵ . Strengthening τ
0
in the Q-extension repeatedly by an application of Proposition 7.4.3, we may
assume that τ sorts out P(Γ)∩V. Let σ be the Q-name for the collection of all
sets in P(Γ)∩V which τ accepts.
Claim 7.4.9. The membership of every set A⊂Γ in σ is decided by the largest
condition in Q.
