does not really depend on the sequence (cid:104)x : n∈ω(cid:105) but only on the set A, and

therefore (cid:104)p¯ : n∈ω(cid:105)∈M as desired.

Item (2) is somewhat trickier. Let N be some generic extension of M which
restores the axiom of choice. In the model N, let B be the compact Hausdorff
space of balanced conditions for P. For each number n ∈ ω, consider the
set C = {p¯ ∈ B: p¯ ≤ p¯ }. This is a nonempty and closed subset of B by

Definition9.2.1(2)and(3). SincetheclosedsetsC forn∈ω formadecreasing

sequence, a compactness argument shows that there must be some p¯∈ C .

This is the required lower bound of the sequence (cid:104)p¯ : n∈ω(cid:105).

Work in the model M. By the forcing theorem, there must be a poset R of

η for an element of ωω such that R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ([y] ) = [η] for

all functions y uniformizing the relation A. The following claim uses the pod
balance assumption.
Claim 9.5.8. There is a condition r ∈ R and a point u ∈ ωω ∩M such that
r (cid:13)η F uˇ.
Proof. Supposetowardsacontradictionthatthisfails. LetH ,H ⊂Rbefilters

mutually generic over the model M. Observe that the models M[H ],M[H ]

Note that for every condition pˆ∈P ∩M, either both p ,p are below pˆor both
0 1
p ,p are incompatible with pˆ. This occurs because by Claim 9.5.6, there is a
0 1
number n ∈ ω such that pˆ∈ V , the virtual condition p¯ is either below pˆ or
n n
incompatible with it by its balance, and p ,p ≤ p¯ . By the pod balance of
0 1 n
the poset P, the conditions p ,p have a lower bound in the poset P. By the
0 1
forcing theorem in M and the initial contradictory assumption, u ,u are not
0 1
F-related to any element of M. By Proposition 9.5.2, u cannot be F-related
0
to u . Thus, the lower bound of p ,p would have to force the unique E-class
1 0 1
of all uniformizations of the set A to be mapped by τ simultaneously to [u ]
0 F
and to [u ] , which is impossible.

Now, the claim together with the forcing theorem means that there is a natural
number n ∈ ω, a point u ∈ V in ωω and in the model V a poset S of size
n n
< κ and an S-name χ for a condition in the poset P stronger than p¯ and an
S-name ξ for an element of (2ω)ω which is not E-related to any point in V
n
such that S (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) χ (cid:13) τ([ξ] ) = [uˇ] . Namely, the poset S
P E F
is a remainder of the iteration of Q and R after the first n-many Q-generic
reals are added. Let H ,H ⊂ S be filters mutually generic over the model

V = V[K][U][x : m ∈ n] and write p = χ/H , y = ξ/H , p = χ/H , and
