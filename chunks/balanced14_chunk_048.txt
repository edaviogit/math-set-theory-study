Since Coll(ω,M) × Coll(ω,N) is a homogeneous notion of forcing, for each
m ∈ M the value of π(mˇ) is decided by the largest condition to be some

Theorem 2.4.5 makes it possible to describe some class-sized virtual spaces ex-
plicitly:
Example 2.4.6. The virtual E -classes are precisely classified by ordinals,
ω1
since E = E where Γ is the class of all well-orderings on ω. Well-orderings
ω1 Γ
are rigid, and up to isomorphism are classified by ordinals.
Example 2.4.7. The virtual HC-classes are classified by transitive sets with
the ∈-relation. Note that all extensional, well-founded relations are rigid and
uniquelyisomorphictoauniquetransitivesetwiththe∈-relationbytheMostowski
collapse theorem [45, Theorem 6.15].

plicated. We will treat the case of acyclic graphs, which has the virtue of being
Borel-complete among the equivalence relations classifiable by countable struc-
tures. Note that the Ehrenfeucht–Fraiss´e equivalence on uncountable acyclic
graphs is distinct from isomorphism, as the case of an empty graph on ℵ or ℵ

vertices shows.

Proof. The point of the proof is that an acyclic graph can be explicitly built
from automorphism orbits of its elements. This procedure is captured in the
following observation. Suppose x is a set, f: x2 →ω+1 is a function such that
f(s,t)>0↔f(t,s)>0, and g: x2 →ω+1 is a function such that f(s,t)>0
implies g(s)=g(t). Then there is, up to an isomorphism unique, acyclic graph
