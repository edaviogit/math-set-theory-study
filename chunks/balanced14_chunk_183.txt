8.8 Side condition forcings
Attempts to force uncountable subsets of Polish spaces with a lack of internal
structure often converge to a kind of a side condition poset. Posets of this kind

are not covered by the previous sections. In this section, we outline several
examples.
Definition 8.8.1. Let X be a Polish space. Let F(X) denote the Effros Borel
space of all closed subsets of X [55, Section 12.C]. Let I ⊂F(X) be a Borel set
(cid:83)
suchthat I =X andI isnotacountableunionofelementsofI. TheposetP
I
consists of pairs p=(cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) where a ⊂X and b ⊂I are countable sets. The
p p p p
(cid:83)
ordering on P is defined by q ≤p if a ⊂a , b ⊂b , and ( b )∩a \a =0.

It is immediate that P is a σ-closed Suslin forcing. It is designed to add an
I
uncountable set which has countable intersection with every element of I. For
the classification of balanced conditions, whenever a ⊂ X is a set, write τ for
a
the Coll(ω,X)-name for the pair (cid:104)aˇ,b˙(cid:105) where b˙ is the name for the set of all
ground model coded sets in I.
Theorem 8.8.2. Let X be a Polish space and let I ⊂F(X) be a Borel set such
(cid:83)
that I =X. Then
1. for every set a⊂X, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) is balanced;
a
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) there is a set a ⊂ X such that the pairs
(cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
a
3. distinct subsets of X yield nonequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.

Proof. Towards(1),unravelingthedefinitions,itissufficientshowthefollowing.
Suppose that R ,R are posets and σ ,σ are respective names for countable

subsetsofX suchthatR (cid:13)σ ∩ (cid:83) (I∩V)=0andR (cid:13)σ ∩ (cid:83) (I∩V)=0;then
0 0 1 1
R ×R (cid:13)σ ∩ (cid:83) (I∩V[G˙ ])=0andσ ∩ (cid:83) (I∩V[G˙ ])=0whereG˙ ,G˙ arethe
0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
respective product names for the generic filters on the 0th and 1st coordinate.
This, however, is immediate. We will show that R × R (cid:13) σ ∩ (cid:83) (I ∩
0 1 0
V[G˙ ]) = 0; the proof of the other assertion is symmetric. Suppose towards a
1
contradiction that η is an R -name for an element of σ , χ is an R -name for
0 0 1
an element of I, and (cid:104)r ,r (cid:105)∈R ×R is a condition forcing that η ∈χ holds.

Let M be a countable elementary submodel of a large structure containing all
objects named so far, let g ⊂R ∩M be a filter generic over M containing the
1 1
condition r , and let F = χ/g . Since F is a closed set in I ∩V, there must
1 1
be a basic open set O ⊂ X and a condition r(cid:48) ≤ r such that O∩F = 0 and
0 0
r(cid:48) (cid:13) η ∈O˙. Bythegenericityofthefilterg andtheforcingtheoremapplied

in the model M, there must be a condition r(cid:48) ≤r such that r(cid:48) (cid:13) O∩χ=0.

Clearly, (cid:104)r(cid:48),r(cid:48)(cid:105)(cid:13)η ∈/ χ, contradicting the initial choice of (cid:104)r ,r (cid:105).

we may assume that Q collapses the size of the ground model continuum to ℵ ;

strengthening the condition σ we may assume that b is forced to contain all

ground model coded elements of I. By a balance argument, for every point
x ∈ X it is the case that either Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ a or Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈/ a . Let a ⊂ X be the
