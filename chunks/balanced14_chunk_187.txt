Proof. Write P =P . Let p∈P be a condition; we must find a virtual weakly
E
balanced condition p¯ ≤ p. Let p¯ = (cid:104)Coll(ω,2ω),(cid:104)aˇ ,ˇb,fˇ(cid:105)(cid:105) where b is the set
p p
of all pairs (cid:104)a ,s(cid:105) where s ⊂ (2ω)n is a closed nowhere dense set coded in the
p
ground model for some n ∈ ω. It is immediate that p¯is a virtual condition; it
will be enough to show that p¯is weakly balanced.
Before we proceed, we must fix some notation and terminology. Let V[G]
be a generic extension of V, and in V[G] let f be a function from the virtual
E-quotient space to the quotient E -space. If M is an intermediate model of
0
ZF between V and V[G], write f|M for the following set. Let γ be the smallest
ordinal such that in M, every E-pin is equivalent to an E-pin of set-theoretic

set many virtual E-classes in V[G]. Let f|M be the set of all pairs (cid:104)(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105),y(cid:105)
such that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) ∈ M is an E-pin of rank smaller than γ, y ∈ 2ω, and for
some virtual E-class c ∈ dom(f), y ∈ f(c) and (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) ∈ c. The transfinite

c will be identified with the virtual E-class of all E-pins (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) such that for
some (all) x ∈ c, Q (cid:13) τ E xˇ; thus, a partial function on the E-quotient space
is viewed as a partial function on the virtual E-quotient space. The heart of a
condition in P is the heart of its last coordinate. The following two key claims
control the behavior of hearts of conditions below p¯.
Claim 8.9.3. Every condition q ∈ P can be strengthened in some generic ex-
tension to a condition r ≤q which has a heart.
Proof. Let V[G] be a generic extension of V, and let q ∈ V[G] be a condition
in P. Work in V[G]. By transfinite recursion on β ≤ω define a finite support
