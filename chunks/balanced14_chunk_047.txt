Theorem 2.4.3. Let M,N be models with the same countable signature. The
following are equivalent:
1. M,N are Ehrenfeucht–Fraiss´e equivalent;

In the language of [96], a sentence φ of L is grounded if every virtual equiv-

alence class is represented by a collapse name for a possibly uncountable model
of φ. In general, there are virtual E-classes which are not represented by a
straightforward collapse name as in Definition 2.4.1, as [50, Section 4] shows.
However, a collapse name can be found for certain classes of structures.
Definition 2.4.4. Let Γ be a coanalytic set of structures on ω, closed un-
der isomorphism. A (possibly uncountable) structure M is a Γ∗∗-structure if
Coll(ω,M)(cid:13)τ ∈Γ.

We proceed to show that for some interesting coanalytic classes Γ, every E¯ -

class is represented by a collapse name of a Γ∗∗-structure as in Definition 2.4.1.

[65].
Theorem 2.4.5. Let Γ be a coanalytic class of countable structures on ω, in-
variant under isomorphism, consisting of rigid structures only.
1. For Γ∗∗-structures, Ehrenfeucht–Fraiss´e equivalence and isomorphism co-
incide;

must hold. As Γ consists of rigid structures even in the collapse extension,
Coll(ω,M)×Coll(ω,N) forces that there is a unique isomorphism π: M →N.
Since Coll(ω,M) × Coll(ω,N) is a homogeneous notion of forcing, for each
m ∈ M the value of π(mˇ) is decided by the largest condition to be some
