claim that p¯(cid:13)τ does not have the Baire property.
To show this, first argue that p¯(cid:13) τ ⊂ X is not meager. Suppose towards
a contradiction that this fails. Then in the model V[K], there exists a poset
R of size < κ and R-names σ for a condition in P stronger than p¯ and η for
a dense G subset of X such that R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ ∩η = 0. Let

G ⊂ Q×S and H ⊂ R be mutually generic filters. By a mutual genericity
argument, G ∈ η/H holds. By a balance argument, the conditions σ/H and

forces in P that Gˇ ∈η/H ∩τ. This is a contradiction.

Question 14.3.2. Does the conclusion of Theorem 14.3.1 remain in force in
weakly balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model?
Other regularity properties of sets of reals may be preserved in the balanced
extensions. Consider the following.
Definition 14.3.3. Let Q be a c.c.c. Suslin forcing. Let P be a Suslin forcing.
We say that P is Q-balanced if for every condition p ∈ P there is a balanced
virtual condition p¯≤ p such that Q (cid:13) p¯is still balanced. Similar terminology
applies for Q-weakly balanced forcings.

Theorem 14.3.4. In Q-weakly balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model, for every set A⊂X there is a Borel set B ⊂X such that A∆B ∈I.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset such that P
is Q-balanced below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model derived from
κ and work in W. Let p ∈ P be a condition and τ be a P-name such that
