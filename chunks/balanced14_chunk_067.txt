First,observethatthepair(cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105)isanE-pin: byelementarity,M |=Q×Q(cid:13)

of M and V, V |= Q×Q (cid:13) σ E σ as well. We will now prove that the
left right
pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a non-trivial E-pin.
Assume towards a contradiction that there exists a point x ∈ X such that
Q(cid:13)σ E xˇ. Wewillshowthattherethenmustbey ∈M∩X whichisE-related

of M and V M |= P (cid:13) τ E yˇ, and this will contradict the elementarity of the
model M and the nontriviality of the name τ.
To find the point y ∈ M ∩X, let N be a countable elementary submodel
of a large structure containing (cid:104)M : α ∈ ω (cid:105),Q,x. Since the tower of models

(cid:104)M : α ∈ ω (cid:105) is continuous, there is a limit ordinal α ∈ ω such that M =

Now, suppose that R is a poset collapsing ℵ . Since |M| = ℵ , in the R-
1 1
extension there is a filter Q-generic over M. Let H˙ be an R-name for such a
filterandletν betheR-nameforσ/H˙. BytheMostowskiabsolutenessbetween
the generic extensions of M and V again, it follows that Q×R (cid:13) σ E ν. We
have just proved that ν is a nontrivial E-pinned name on R.
Theorem 2.6.3 does not rule out the possibility that some ℵ preserving
1
posets carry nontrivial E-pinned names. This does not occur for orbit equiv-
alence relations. In them, every pinned name is inescapably connected with a
collapse of a certain cardinal to ℵ . To state this in the most informative way,

we introduce a piece of notation. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on
a Polish space X, and let c be a virtual E-class. We write κ(c) for the smallest
cardinalityofaposetP suchthatthereisanE-pinnedP-nameσ suchthatthe
E-pin (cid:104)P,σ(cid:105) belongs to c.
Theorem 2.6.4. Let E be an equivalence relation on a Polish space X, Borel
reducible to an orbit equivalence relation of a Polish group action. Let c be a
virtual E-class and write κ=κ(c). The following are equivalent for every poset
P:
1. there is an E-pinned P-name σ such that the E-pin (cid:104)P,σ(cid:105) belongs to c;
2. P (cid:13)|κ|=ℵ .

an E-pin in c such that |R| = κ. Let M be an elementary submodel of a
large structure such that |M| = κ, R ⊂ κ, and R,τ ∈ M. By the collapsing
