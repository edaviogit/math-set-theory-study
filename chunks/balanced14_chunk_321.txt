Theorem 13.2.7 applies to it, as do all other theorems of Section 13.2.
Corollary 13.3.6. Let A⊂R be a countable set of positive relas converging to
zero. Let Γ be the graph on R2 connecting two points if their Euclidean distance
belongs to A.
1. Let P be the coloring poset of Definition 8.1.1. In the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, there are no discontinuous homomorphisms of
Polish groups, and there is no linear ordering of the E -quotient space.

2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
chromatic number of Γ is countable, and yet there is no discontinuous
homomorphism between Polish groups and no linear ordering of the E -

The next example shows that the tether assumption is necessary in Theo-

The following example shows that the pinned assumption in Theorem 13.2.5 is
necessary.

space X. Let P be the transversal poset of Example 6.6.8. The poset P is
