Now, a twice repeated use of the Bernstein balance of the virtual condition
p¯in V[K] with the families H ,H , H yields points y ,y ,y ∈ 2ω such that

the conditions p = σ/H , p = σ/H , and p = σ/H have a common

same time, by the forcing theorem in V[K], the common lower bound of the
conditions p ,p ,p forces the numbers τ(xˇ ), τ(xˇ ), and τ(xˇ ) to be at least

1/2 each. This contradicts the assumption that τ was forced to be a diffuse
finitely additive measure.

Definition 12.2.4. OCA is the following statement. Whenever X is a Polish
space, A ⊂ X is a set, and Γ is a graph on A which is open in the topology
on A×A inherited from X ×X, then either A is a union of countably many
Γ-anticliques, or A contains an uncountable Γ-clique.
