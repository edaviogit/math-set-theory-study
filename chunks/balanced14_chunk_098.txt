The main import of the concentration of measure assumption is that for any
open neighborhood U of the unit, closed U-connected µ-positive sets can be
found under every stone.

98 CHAPTER 3. TURBULENCE
Proposition 3.6.5. Suppose that the action of Γ has concentration of measure
and d is an ultrametric. Then for every open neighborhood U ⊂ Γ of the unit
and every µ-positive Borel set C ⊂X there is a µ-positive U-connected compact
set D ⊂C.
Proof. Wewillfirstfixusefulterminology. ForasymmetricneighborhoodV ⊂Γ
containing the unit and d-balls B ,B ⊂ X of the same radius we say that B

is V-related to B if there is an element γ ∈V such that γ·B =B . Since d is

anultrametric, thisisequivalenttothestatementthatthereisγ ∈V suchthat
γ·B ∩B (cid:54)= 0. A set B consisting of d-balls of the same radius will be called
0 1
V-connected if for any two balls B ,B ∈ B one can find a sequence of balls
0 1
in B which starts with B , ends in B , and successive balls in it are V-related.

Lastly, for Borel sets B,D ⊂ X write µ (D) for the relative measure of D in
B
B, i.e. the ratio µ(B∩D).
µ(B)
Let U ⊂Γ be an open neighborhood of the unit, and let C ⊂X be a Borel
µ-positive set. Find a symmetric open neighborhood V ⊂ Γ of the unit such
that V4 ⊂ U, and thin down C if necessary to a compact µ-positive set. Let
ε = 1/8 and for each n ∈ ω let ε = 2−n−2ε . Let δ > 0 be the numbers

radius <δ such that C ⊂B and µ (C)>1/2.

By recursion on n ∈ ω find finite families B of pairwise disjoint d-balls of

To begin, set B = {B }. Now, suppose that B has been constructed and

B ∈ B is a ball; we shall show how to construct the set Y(B) and therefore
