universality, suppose that a ⊂ M is a set, choose an ordinal α such that all
ω
sets in a have rank smaller than α, and form the set b = V ∩M . Since M
α ω ω
is a class in each model M , the set b is in all models M and therefore in M .

Clearly, a⊂b, concluding the proof of universality.
To show that M is a class in M , let λ be a large limit cardinal in V so
ω 0
that M is a generic extension of V by a poset in V , and such that V satisfies
0 λ λ
a large fragment of ZFC. Note that then, all the models M are also obtained
n
from V as generic extensions by posets in V . Move to the model M . Let f be
λ 0
the function from ω to M ∩V such that f(n)={(cid:104)P,G(cid:105): P ∈V ∩V , G∈M
0 λ λ n
is a filter on P generic over V, and whenever (cid:104)Q,H(cid:105) is a pair consisting of a
poset in V ∩V and a filter on Q in M generic over V, there is a P-name σ
λ n
in V such that σ/G = H}. The coherence of the sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) shows
n
that the function f can be formed in M . Then, M is exactly the collection
0 ω
of all sets x such that for every n ∈ ω and every pair (cid:104)P,G(cid:105) ∈ f(n), x ∈ V[G].
Since V is a class in M , this shows that M is a class in M as well.

Example 4.2.10. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, with a normal measure
U on κ and the associated ultrapower j: V → M. Let j : M → M
nm n m
(cid:84)
be the iterands of j for n ≤ m ≤ ω. Then M = M [c] holds where
n∈ω n ω
c = (cid:104)j (κ): n ∈ ω(cid:105) [20, 15]. It is well-known and follows from the geometric
0n
description of Prikry genericity by Mathias [69] that the set c is generic over
the model M for the Prikry forcing associated with the measure j U.

Example 4.2.11. Let c : ω ×ω → 2 be a Cohen-generic map, and let c =
0 1 n
c (cid:22) ω ×(ω\n). Let M = V[c ]. In the model M = (cid:84) M , the chromatic
0 1 n n ω n n
number of G is greater than 2; thus, the Axiom of Choice must fail in M .
0 ω
Proof. Work in V. For each number n ∈ ω, let P be the poset of all finite
n
functions from ω ×(ω\n) to 2 ordered by extension. Note that for each n∈ω

the map c is P -generic over V. For each ordinal α∈ω and a number n∈ω,

let d˙ be a name for the function defined by letting d (m) be 0 if m∈n and

By a standard ∆-system argument, strengthening p if necessary, we may

Find a condition q ≤ p and a P -name τ such that q (cid:13) σ = τ; this is possible
