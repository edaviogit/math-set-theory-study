198 CHAPTER 8. OTHER FORCINGS
We will show that if r ≤p¯is a condition with heart (cid:104)M,h(cid:105) of depth α, then
in some forcing extension there is a filter H ⊂ R generic over V such that
α
writing (cid:104)N,k(cid:105) for the heart of τ /H, then (cid:104)M,h(cid:105)=(cid:104)N,k(cid:105). This will prove the
α
first item since the theory of (cid:104)M,h(cid:105) (with parameter h and other parameters in
the ground model) is then exactly the collection of those statements which R
α
forces to be true in the heart of τ . The second item of the claim ???
α
The following claim just restates the information from the previous claim in a
form that will be useful later.
Claim 8.9.5. Let r ≤ p¯ be a condition in P in some generic extension with
heart (cid:104)M,h(cid:105). Then
1. every E-class in dom(f ) is either a realization of a virtual E-class in
r
dom(h) or it is not a realization of any virtual E-class in M;
2. every finite tuple c of pairwise E -unrelated elements of a \ (cid:83) rng(h)) is
0 r
product Cohen-generic over M.
Proof. The first item is an immediate consequence of the definition of the
heart. For the second item, we use the fact that r ≤ p¯. Let n = |c|. Every
closed nowhere dense subset s⊂(2ω)n in the model M belongs to some model
V[d] where d is a finite tuple of pairwise E -unrelated elements of (cid:83) rng(h)\

We have just shown that c does not belong to any closed nowhere dense subset
of (2ω)n in the model M; that is, c is product Cohen-generic over M.
Finally, we are ready to conclude the proof of Theorem 8.9.2. Let Q ,Q be

posets in V, with names σ ,σ for conditions in P stronger than p¯. We must

extension (such as the Q -extension) where there is a condition r ≤ p¯ with a

heart of depth α . Let M be the models arising in the transfinite analysis of

r, and let N =M ,h =f |N and N =M ,h =f |N . Thus, (cid:104)N ,h (cid:105) is

of E-classes which are realizations of the virtual classes in dom(h ).
