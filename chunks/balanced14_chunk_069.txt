68 CHAPTER 2. THE VIRTUAL REALM
The latter statement is easier: Q forces D to be the range of the partial
function f on ω×ω defined by f(n,m)=q if η(n)(cid:13)η(m)=qˇ. For the former
statement, first note that D ⊂Q is dense since D is forced to contain the range
ofη. ItfollowsthatD andQviewedasposetsgivethesameextensionsandτ is

Γ
and the D-extension, there must be a D-name χ for an element of X such
that D (cid:13) h˙(χ) F τ. Since h is a reduction, it follows that (cid:104)Q,χ(cid:105) is an E-pin
equivalent to (cid:104)P,σ(cid:105). By the initial choice of the cardinal κ, |Q|≥κ follows.
Corollary 2.6.6. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X, Borel reducible to an orbit equivalence relation. If E is not pinned then the
following are equivalent for any partial order P:
1. P carries a nontrivial E-pinned name;
2. P collapses ℵ to ℵ .

Proof. (2) implies (1) by Theorem 2.6.3. For the opposite implication, let τ
be a nontrivial E-pinned name on P. Let κ be the cardinal of Theorem 2.6.4
associated with the virtual E-class containing (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105). Note that κ cannot be
ℵ since then the Cohen poset would carry an E-pinned name equivalent to τ;
0
however, all E-pinned names on the Cohen poset are trivial by Theorem 2.6.2.

particular it must collapse ℵ .

2.7 Absoluteness
This section compiles the available information regarding the absoluteness of
various notions regarding the virtual equivalence classes. The most substantial

its pinned status is absolute among all generic extensions.

space X. The following are equivalent:
