by Proposition 11.2.9. To check the liminf-centered property, suppose that
{(cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105): i ∈ ω} are conditions in C . Strengthening if necessary, we may

The theorem follows by a routine transfinite induction argument.
The following question probably has a negative answer; still, products of the
very Suslin σ-liminf-centered posets used later in the chapter are again Suslin
σ-liminf-centered.
Question 11.3.23. Is the class of Suslin σ-liminf-centered posets closed under
product?

Inthissection,weconcentrateontasksofaveryspecificformcommontomany
concerns of modern descriptive set theory. These tasks start with a countable

ture of some type to each E-class; at the same time, distinct E-classes do not
communicate with each other in any way. Reviewing the tasks of this type, it
becomes obvious that often there is a locally countable simplicial complex K
on X such that the associated equivalence relation E (as identified in Defini-
K
tion 6.1.3) is E, and we seek a maximal K-set. Sometimes, the domain of the
simplicial complex K is instead the collection of finite subsets of X consisting
of pairwise E-related points, and sometimes we actually seek a maximal K-set
