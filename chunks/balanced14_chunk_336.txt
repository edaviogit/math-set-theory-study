Since χ is forced to be balanced, we also have Q (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) χ decides
the statement (cid:104)η ,η (cid:105) ∈ τ. Let q ∈ Q be a condition such that q (cid:13) Coll(ω,<

condition q in the iteration Q ∗Q˙ . Use the λ+-c.c. of the poset Q to find an

ordinal α∈λ+ such that q is a condition in Qα and q˙ is a Qα-name.

Proof. Let I =λ∪(2×λ). Consideranybijectionπ: I →I suchthat π(cid:48)(cid:48)λ=λ.
Such a bijection induces an automorphism of the poset Q and the class of Q-
names, which by an abuse of notation we denote by π again. If in addition
we assume that π(cid:48)(cid:48){0}×λ = {1}×λ and π(cid:48)(cid:48){1}×λ = π{0}×λ, then the
automorphism switches the names η and η . If in addition we assume that
0 1
π(cid:48)(cid:48)α is disjoint from α and π(cid:48)(cid:48)(2×α) is disjoint from 2×α, then the conditions
q,π(q) are compatible. Let G ⊂ Q be a filter generic over V[K] meeting the
0 0
lower bound of q and π(q), and let G = (π−1)(cid:48)(cid:48)G . The filters G ,G are as

required.
Now, let G ,G be filters as in the claim. Let A = η /G = η /G and
