The notion of a weakly balanced pair is a faithful extension of the notion of a
balanced pair. This is the content of the following proposition.
Proposition 5.3.4. Let P be a Suslin forcing.
1. Every balanced pair is weakly balanced;
2. the class of balanced pairs is invariant under the ≡ equivalence;
wb
3. the relations ≡ and ≡ coincide on balanced pairs.

Now, let L ⊂ S ,L ⊂ S be filters mutually generic over V. The balance
