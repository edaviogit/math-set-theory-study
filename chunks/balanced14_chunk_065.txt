In the end, let r be the function defined by dom(r)=dom(p)∪dom(q), for all
α ∈ dom(p) let r(α) = p(α)∪{m : α appears in u }, and for all β ∈ dom(q)
i i
let r(β) = q(β)∪{m : β appears in u }. It is not difficult to check that r is a
i i
common lower bound of the conditions p,q as desired.
Claim 2.5.42. For every α∈κ the set D ={p∈P: α∈dom(r)} is dense in
α
P.
Proof. Let α ∈ κ be an ordinal and p ∈ P be a condition; we must produce
a condition q ≤ p such that α ∈ dom(q). It will be the case that q(α) ∩
(cid:83)
max( rng(p))+1=0; this way, q(α) will be lexicographically smaller than all
q(β) for β ∈ dom(p). List dom(p) as β for i ∈ j, and find pairwise distinct
i
numbers m for i∈j so that

• m ∈a where g(α,β)=m and g(α,β)=n;

(cid:83)
• each m is greater than max( rng(p)).

Then, let q be the function defined by dom(q)=dom(p)∪{α} and q(β )=
i
p(β )∪{m } and q(α) = {m : i ∈ j}. It is immediate that the condition q
i i i
works.
Now it is easy to see that if G ⊂ P is a generic filter, the function π: κ →
(cid:83)
P(ω) defined by π(α) = {p(α): p ∈ G} induces a homomorphism of ¬T to
¬R as desired.
Example 2.5.43. Let X be a Polish space and let R be a combinatorially
universal Borel equivalence relation on X2 with countably many classes. Let G
be the hypergraph on X consisting of all unions b ∪b where b ,b are infinite

sets such that b ×b is a subset of a single R-class.

Proof. The argument is based on and motivated by two results of Todorcevic
[92]. Namely, if Chang’s conjecture holds, then for every partition of ω2 into
2
countably many pieces, one piece of the partition contains a product of infinite
sets. In addition, if Martin’s Axiom for ℵ holds and Chang’s conjecture fails,
2
then there is a partition of ω2 into countably many pieces such that no piece of
2
the partition contains a product of infinite sets.
Now, for (1) use the first result of Todorcevic to argue that under Chang’s
conjecturethereisnoG-anticliqueofsizeℵ , sobyProposition2.5.27, κ(E )≤

ℵ . For (2), suppose that Martin’s Axiom holds and Chang’s conjecture fails.

By the second result of Todorcevic, find an equivalence relation T on ω2 with

universality of the equivalence relation R to find an injection π: ω →X which

is a homomorphism of ¬T to ¬R. Observe that rng(π) is a G-anticlique of size
ℵ . By Proposition 2.5.27, κ(E )>ℵ .
