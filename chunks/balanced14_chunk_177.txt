The proof of (2) is literally copied from the proof of Theorem 8.5.3(2). (3)

[34]: for every number n ≥ 2, 2ℵ0 ≤ ℵ
n−1
holds if and only if there is a set
mapping f: [2ω]n →[2ω]<ℵ0 without a free set of size n+1. Thus, if 2ℵ0 >ℵ
2
,
by (2) there are no balanced conditions and P is not balanced. On the other
hand, suppose that 2ℵ0 ≤ ℵ
2
holds, and let p ∈ P be a condition. To produce
a balanced virtual condition stronger than p, let g: [X]3 → [X]<ℵ0 be a set
mapping without a free set of size 4. Enumerate the set d(p) by (cid:104)x : i ∈ ω(cid:105)
i
and let f: [X]3 → [X]<ℵ0 be a function defined by f(a) = p(a) if a ⊂ d(p),
f(a) = g(a) if a∩d(p) = 0, and f(a) = g(a)∪{x : i ∈ n} where n is the
i
smallest number such that x ∈ dom(a), for sets a such that a (cid:54)⊂ d(p) and
n
a∩d(p)(cid:54)=0. It is not difficult to see that f is a set mapping without a free set
of size 4 such that p ⊂ f; therefore, by (1) it represents a balanced condition
stronger than p.
8.6 Saturated models on quotient spaces
Onecanusequotientsimplicialcomplexforcingstoaddstructurestothevarious
quotient spaces as long as the structures satisfy a well-known amalgamation
property from model theory. We will first review the definitions. For first order
structures M,N in the same language, a map π: M → N is an morphism if
it is an injection from dom(M) to dom(N) which transports all relations and
functions of M to the corresponding relations and functions in N.

We will tacitly assume that our Fraiss´e classes contain arbitrarily large finite
structures. Fraiss´e classes are prominent in model theory [41, Theorems 5.3.3
and 5.3.5], Ramsey theory [71, 23], and topological dynamics [53, 106]. The
classes we can handle satisfy a well-known stronger version of amalgamation:

ever M,N ,N ∈ F are structures and π : M → N and π : M → N are
