G is countable while the chromatic number of G is uncountable.

Question 1.3.14. Let n > 1 be a number. Is it consistent with ZF+DC that
the chromatic number of G is countable while the chromatic number of G

is uncountable?
Hypergraphs of arity higher than 2 present enormous challenges. To illustrate
the possibilities, call a coloring c: R2 → ω an equilateral triangle-free decom-
position if there is no equilateral triangle whose vertices are painted the same
color. Ceder [17] showed that in ZF, the existence of a Hamel basis implies the
existence of an equilateral tringle-free decomposition. The opposite implication
does not go through:
Theorem 1.3.15. ItisconsistentwithZF+DCthattheequilateraltriangle-free
decomposition exists and yet there is no discontinuous homomorphism between
Polish groups.
Ultrafilters. Themethodsofthebookcanseparatevarioustypesofultrafilters

Theorem 1.3.16. (Corollary 9.2.5, Proposition 9.2.22 and Corollary ??) In
ZF+DC, there are no provable implications between the existence of a Hamel
basis and existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on natural numbers.
Improving [37], we have
Theorem 1.3.17. (Corollary 14.6.7) In ZF+DC, the existence of a nonprinci-
pal ultrafilter on natural numbers does not imply the existence of one which is
disjoint from the summable ideal.

erties: Ramsey ultrafilters and stable ordered union ultrafilters are just two
examples. However, the comparison of the various models obtained as well as
a classification of ultrafilters appearing in each model seems to be beyond our
skill. Many other combinations of implications remain unresolved. For exam-
ple, we do not know how to construct a model of ZF+DC in which there is a
nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω, |E |≤|E | and yet |E |(cid:54)≤|2ω|.
