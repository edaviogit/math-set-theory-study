perfectness a rather complicated projective property of the poset P. In all
particular posets considered in this book, the status of perfectness is absolute

300 CHAPTER 12. THE SILVER DIVIDE
Proposition 12.1.3. Every Suslin forcing which is perfect in all forcing exten-
sions and balanced is perfectly balanced and every balanced virtual condition is
perfectly balanced.
Proof. Let p¯ be a balanced virtual condition. Let Q be a partial order, σ a
Q-name for a condition in P stronger than p¯. Let V[G] be a generic extension
such that P(Q)∩V is countable in V[G]. Let H be a perfect set of filters on Q
which consists of filters in finite tuples mutually generic over V.
Claim 12.1.4. For every finite set a ⊂ H, the set {σ/H: H ∈ a} ⊂ P has a
common lower bound.
Proof. Let(cid:104)H : j ∈i(cid:105)enumeratethesetawithoutrepetitions. Byinductionon

each j ∈i r ∈V[K][H : k ∈j] and r ≤σ/H . This is easy to do using the
j k j+1 j
balance of the condition p¯at every stage of the induction, noting that σ/H ,r
j j
are both strengthenings of p¯in mutually generic extensions of the model V[K].
In the end, the condition r is a lower bound of the set {σ/H: H ∈a}.

Now, let h: 2ω → H be a continuous injection and let f: 2ω → P be the
continuous function defined by f(y) = σ/h(y). Apply the perfectness of the
poset P to find a perfect set C such that for each y ∈C, r ≤f(y) holds in the
separative quotient. The condition r witnesses the perfect balance of p¯in this
instance.
We prove two notable dichotomy type preservation properties of perfectly bal-
anced posets.
Definition 12.1.5. The full Silver dichotomy is the following statement: If E

As a consequence, the full Silver dichotomy implies that among all sets whose

[48, Theorem 5.7.1], a theorem of ZF+DC which says in particular that the
dichotomy holds for analytic sets A ⊂ X. The Solovay model satisfies the full
Silver dichotomy. The following result is stated using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 12.1.6. In the cofinally perfectly balanced extensions of the symmet-
ric Solovay model, the full Silver dichotomy holds.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a perfect Suslin forcing such
that V |= P is balanced in every forcing extension. Let W be a symmetric
κ
Solovay model derived from κ and work in the model W. Let p ∈ P be a
condition and τ be a P-name such that p (cid:13) τ ⊂ X is an E-invariant set
containing uncountably many E-classes. The condition p as well as the name τ
have to be definable from parameters in V as well as some parameter z ∈ 2ω.
