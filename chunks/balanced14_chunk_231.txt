10.3. WELL-ORDERABLE UNIFORMIZATION 243
Theorem 10.3.2. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
In tethered, cofinally balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model, E-
well-orderable uniformization holds.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset which is
balancedcofinallybelowκandtetheredbelowκ. LetW thesymmetricSolovay
model derived from κ. In the model W, let p ∈ P be a condition and τ be
a P-name such that p (cid:13) τ ⊂ 2ω ×X is a set whose vertical sections are well-
orderableunionsofE-classes. Letz ∈2ω beaparametersuchthatp,τ areboth
definable from z and some additional ground model parameters. Let G⊂P be
a generic filter meeting the condition p and let B = τ/G. Work in the model
W[G].
Fix a point y ∈2ω and consider the model M of all sets hereditarily defin-
y
able from parameters y,z,G and parameters in the ground model. Note that

orem 9.1.1; in fact, it is a generic extension of the ground model by a poset of
size<κ. WeclaimthattheverticalsectionB consistsofrealizationsofvirtual

E-classes of the model M . Once this is proved, one can decompose the set B

(cid:83)
into the union B = B by setting (cid:104)y,x(cid:105) ∈ B if (cid:104)y,x(cid:105) ∈ B and x belongs

To this end, use Claim 10.2.3 to argue that there is a balanced virtual con-

this model, Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p¯(cid:13) τ consists of realizations of virtual E-classes

the forcing theorem applied in M .

Suppose towards a contradiction that the forcing statement in the previous
paragraph fails and work in M . In view of Corollary 9.1.3, there exist a poset
