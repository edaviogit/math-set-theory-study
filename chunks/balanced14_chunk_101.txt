3.6. A VARIATION FOR MEASURE 101
By the Baire category theorem, there must be an element γ ∈ U(cid:48) which
belongs to no meager subset of Γ coded in the model V[x(cid:48)] and also to no right

Theorem 3.6.2 follows!
The main corollaries are encapsulated in the following ergodicity result.
Corollary 3.6.10. Suppose that Γ is a Polish group acting on a Polish space X
with a Borel probability measure µ and an ultrametric d in a measure preserving
and distance preserving fashion. Suppose that the action has concentration of
measure. Suppose that E is the orbit equivalence relation, Y is a Polish space,
F on Y is an analytic virtually placid equivalence relation, and h: X →Y is a
Borel homomorphism from X to Y. Then there is an F-equivalence class with
µ-positive h-preimage.
Proof. Let γ ∈ Γ and x ∈ X be mutually P -generic and P -generic points,
Γ µ
and look at the models V[x] and V[γ·x]. Since h is a homomorphism of E to
F and x E γ ·x, h(x) F h(γ ·x) must hold. Since F is virtually placid and
V[x]∩V[γ·x]=V holds per Theorem 3.6.2, there must be a virtual F-class in
