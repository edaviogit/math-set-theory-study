Note that an equivalence relation E as above for α≥2 cannot be reducible
to F and F cannot be reducible to it. This answers a question of Kechris

[48, Question 17.6.1] in the negative as well as some related questions of Simon
Thomas. To see that F cannot be Borel reducible to any E, suppose for con-

extension in which c > ℵ . There, h is still a reduction of E to F, while

Hypothesis holds instead.
The following two examples deal with jump operations designed to mimic
cardinal exponentiation. They lead to nonreducibility results which, at least on

as to whether the large cardinal assumptions are necessary for the conclusion.
Definition 2.5.19. Let Γ,∆ be coanalytic classes of structures on ω, invariant
underisomorphism. ThesymbolΓ∆ standsforthecoanalyticclassofstructures
M on ω of the following form: ω is partitioned into infinite sets ω = a∪b∪c,
on M (cid:22)a is a structure in class Γ, M (cid:22)b is a structure in class ∆, and there is
an extra relation R ⊂ c×b×a such that for every m ∈ c, the vertical section
R is a function from b to a, and for m (cid:54)= m ∈ c the vertical sections R

Proposition 2.5.20. Suppose that the classes Γ, ∆ consist of rigid structures
only. Then
1. Γ∆ consists of rigid structures only;
2. κ(Γ∆)=sup{κλ: κ<κ(Γ),λ<κ(∆)}.

Example 2.5.21. Let ∆ be the class of structures isomorphic to (cid:104)ω,∈(cid:105) (con-
sisting of just one equivalence class). For every countable ordinal α, let Γ be
α
the class derived in Corollary 2.5.18. Let E be the equivalence relation of iso-
morphism on the class (Γ )∆ and F be the isomorphism equivalence relation

on the class E . Then E is not Borel reducible to F ×F.
