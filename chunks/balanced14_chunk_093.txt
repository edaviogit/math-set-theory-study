the set A is coanalytic, and by
Mostowski absoluteness it will hold in all forcing extensions.
Theorem 3.4.6. The equivalence relation = is placid for every countably sep-
I
arated Borel ideal I on ω.

3.4. EXAMPLES AND OPERATIONS 93
Proof. Let {a : n∈ω} be a countable collection of subsets of ω witnessing the
n
countable separation of the ideal I. Write X = (2ω)ω. Let V[G ],V[G ] be
0 1
generic extensions containing respective = -related points x ,x ∈X. Assume
I 0 1
V[G ]∩V[G ] = V and work to find a ground model point x ∈ X which is
0 1
= -related to both x ,x .
I 0 1
Consider the set b={n∈ω: x (cid:22)a is I-equivalent to some element of the
0 n
ground model}. The definition of the set b depends only on the = -equivalence
I
class of x , therefore the set b belongs to both V[G ] and V[G ], and by the
0 0 1
initial assumptions, to V. Let f be the map with domain b which to each n∈b
identifies the = -class in V which contains x (cid:22) a . Again, the definition of
I 0 n
f depends only on the = -class of x , so f ∈ V[G ] and f ∈ V[G ], therefore
I 0 0 1
f ∈ V. By the Mostowski absoluteness between V and V[G ], there is a point
0
x∈X such that for all n∈b, x(cid:22)a ∈f(n). We will show that x= x holds.
n I 0
Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Consider the set c = {i ∈
ω: x(i) (cid:54)= x (i)} ∈/ I and the set d = {i ∈ ω: x (i) (cid:54)= x (i)} ∈ I. By the
0 0 1
countable separation of the ideal I, there must be a number n ∈ ω such that
c∩a ∈/ I and d∩a = 0. However, the latter equality shows that x (cid:22) a =
n n 0 n
x (cid:22) a , so x (cid:22) a ∈ V and n ∈ b. But then {i ∈ a : x(i) (cid:54)= x (i)} ∈ I by the
1 n 0 n n 0
choice of the point x. This contradicts the fact that c∩a ∈/ I. The proof of
n
the theorem is complete.

Definition 3.4.7. Let I be an ideal on ω. I+ is the ideal on ω consisting of all
sets b⊂ω such that there is c∈I such that ∀n∈ω b∩a ∈/ I →c∩a (cid:54)=0.

We will start with some simple observations. It is clear that I+ is an ideal
containingI asasubset. IfI isanalytic,thensoisI+. Moreover,I isseparated
by the sequence {a : n ∈ ω} just in case I = I+. We will show that under
n
suitable additional assumption, the jump preserves placidity of the equivalence
relation = .

is a subset c(cid:48) ⊂ c such that for every finite set d ⊂ ω, if c∩ (cid:84) a ∈/ I then
n∈d n
c(cid:48)∩ (cid:84) a ∈/ I and if c∩ (cid:84) a ∈I then c(cid:48)∩ (cid:84) a is finite.

It is not dificult to see that every F ideal is skew and every analytic P-ideal is

skew.
Theorem 3.4.9. If I is a skew analytic ideal on ω then I+ is a skew ana-
lytic ideal as well. If in addition the equivalence relation = is placid then the
I
equivalence relation = is placid as well.
