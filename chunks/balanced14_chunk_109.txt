Most examples of choice-coherent sequences are generic and obtained from the
trivial one (cid:104)M = V : n ∈ ω(cid:105) by a coherent forcing which satisfies a certain

degree of completeness.
Definition 4.3.3. Let (cid:104)P ,π ,ξ : n≤m∈ω(cid:105) be a commutative system of
n nm mn
projections from posets P to P for n≤m.

Example 4.3.4. Suppose that (cid:104)Q : m ∈ ω(cid:105) are arbitrary posets, and let

Theorem 4.3.5. Let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a choice-coherent sequence of models of

ZFC. Let (cid:104)P ,π ,ξ : n ≤ m ∈ ω(cid:105) be a coherent sequence of posets which is

diagonally distributive in M . Let G ⊂ P be a filter generic over M , and let

Proof. Write M = M . We start with (1). The main task is to find a

(cid:84)
poset P ∈M and a filter G ⊂P generic over M such that M [G ]=

M [G ].

Using the choice coherence of the original sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105), we may
n
assume that there is a sequence (cid:104)α : n ∈ ω(cid:105) such that the underlying set
n
of each poset P is exactly α . For each condition p ∈ P , the ordinal ω-
n n 0
sequence (cid:104)π (p): n ∈ ω(cid:105) belongs to M , since for each number k ∈ ω, the
0n ω
tail (cid:104)π (p): n≥k(cid:105) is reconstructed as (cid:104)π (π (p)): n≥k(cid:105) in the model M .

Similarly, the set P ={q ∈ P : ∃k ∈ω ∀n≥k q(n)=π (q(k))} belongs

many numbers n ∈ ω, q (n) ≤ q (n) in the poset P , and conclude that the
