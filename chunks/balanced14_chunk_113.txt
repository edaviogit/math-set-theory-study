Let K ⊂Coll(ω,λ) be a filter generic over the model M [H : i≤n][γ]. The

Example 4.3.10. Consider the equivalence relation E on X = (2ω)ω; it is
1
well-known not to be reducible to any orbit equivalence relation [48, Theorem
11.8.1]. The conclusion of Theorem 4.3.6 fails for E . To see this, choose any
1
partial order Q which adds a new point y˙ ∈ 2ω. Let P be the full support
product of ω-many copies of Q, and let P be the product of the copies of the
n
copiesofQindexedbynaturalnumbers≥n. TheposetsP forn∈ω naturally
n
form a coherent sequence. Let G⊂P be a generic filter, and for each n∈ω let
G ⊂P be the restriction of G to conditions in P . Theorem 4.3.5 shows that
n n n
(cid:84)
(cid:104)V[G ]: n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a choice-coherent sequence of models, and that V[G ]
n n n
contains no new reals compared to V. In V[G ], let x ∈ X be the sequence
n n
defined by letting x (m) be the zero sequence if m ∈ n and the evaluation of
n
y˙ by the n-th coordinate of the generic filter G otherwise. It is clear that the
points x all represent the same E -class, which is not represented in V and
n 1
(cid:84)
therefore in V[G ].

As a final remark, in general it is necessary to consider virtual E-classes as
opposed to just E-classes in the statement of Theorem 4.3.6. To see this, start
