14.4. DEFINABLY BALANCED FORCING 349
where P is the MAD forcing of Definition 8.9.6. It will be enough to show
that P is Q-weakly balanced, where Q is the Suslin c.c.c. poset Q of closed
subsets of R of positive Lebesgue measure ordered by inclusion. Now, certain
weakly balanced conditions for P have been discovered in Theorem 8.9.7. Let
p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) be a condition. Then any (collapse name for a) pair p¯ = (cid:104)a ,c(cid:105)
p p p
is a weakly balanced condition where c is the set of all pairs (cid:104)a ,s(cid:105) where s is
p
a partition of ω into finite intervals in the ground model. Now, let G ⊂ Q be
a generic filter, and in the extension V[G], consider any (collapse name for a)
pair p˜=(cid:104)a ,d(cid:105) where d is the set of all pairs (cid:104)a ,s(cid:105) where s is a partition of ω
p p
into finite intervals in V[G]. By Theorem 8.9.7 applied in V[G], p˜is a weakly
balanced condition in V[G]. Since the poset Q is bounding, for every partition
s ∈ V[G] of ω into finite intervals there is a partition t ∈ V of ω such that
every interval in t contains a subinterval in s. It follows immediately from the
definition of the poset P that p¯,p˜are inseparable in the poset P; in particular,
p¯is still a weakly balanced condition in V[G].
14.4 Definably balanced forcing
This section is devoted to the class of apparently the softest balanced Suslin
extensions one can find: those in which the balanced virtual conditions can be
found in an easily definable way.
Definition 14.4.1. Let P be a Suslin forcing. We say that P is definably
balanced if for each condition p∈P there is a balanced virtual condition p¯≤p
which is definable from a real parameter.
Example 14.4.2. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space
X the poset P of Example 6.6.9 adding a countable complete section of E is
definablybalanced. Namely,letY =Xω,letB ⊂Y bethesetofthoseelements
y ∈Y whoserangeconsistsofpairwiseE-relatedpoints,andletP consistofall
countablesetsp⊂B suchthatify ,y ∈P satisfy[rng(y )] =[rng(y )] then
0 1 0 E 1 E
in fact rng(y ) = rng(y ) holds. The ordering on P is that of inclusion. For
0 1
every condition p∈P one can look at the definable balanced virtual condition
p¯≤p represented by the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ(cid:105) where τ is the name for the set of
(cid:83)
all conditions q ∈Q such that p⊂q and for every point x∈V \ [rng(y)] ,
y∈p E
q contains an enumeration of the set [x] ∩V.

Example 14.4.3. Let P be the poset of Section 8.4 adding a cofinal Kurepa
family on a fixed Polish space X. For every condition p ∈ P (a countable set
of countable subsets of X closed under intersection) one can find a balanced
virtual condition p¯≤ p represented by the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ(cid:105) where τ is the
namefortheconditionobtainedfrompbyaddingthesetX∩V. Thisisindeed
a balanced pair as proved in Theorem 8.4.3, and it is definable from a real.
Example 14.4.4. Let P be the partial ordering introducing a nontrivial au-
tomorphism of the algebra P(ω) modulo finite as in Section 8.3. As proved in
