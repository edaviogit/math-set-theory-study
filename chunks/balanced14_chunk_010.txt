C can be grouped into several large areas.
Cardinalities of quotient spaces. Mirroring the traditional concerns of de-
scriptive set theory, we work on cardinalities of quotient spaces of Borel equiv-

on each, descriptive set theorists study the question when there can be a Borel
function h: X → Y which reduces E to F. This line of work has been very
successful in the last two decades.
In the ZF+DC context, the E- and F-quotient spaces can have distinct
cardinalities,andtheexistenceofaBorelreductionimpliestheinequality|E|≤
|F|, where we abuse the notation to write |E| for the cardinality of the E-
quotient space. On the other hand, the nonexistence of a Borel reduction is
often connected with the possibility that ZF+DC cannot prove the cardinal
inequality |E| ≤ |F|. A number of our results deal with the question whether
a given Σ2 statement is consistent with ZF+DC plus a statement of the type

|E| (cid:54)≤ |F| for some benchmark Borel equivalence relations E,F identified in
Section 1.7.
The most commonly considered quotient space cardinal inequality is |E |>

the E-quotient space can be linearly ordered;

5. (Corollary 11.4.12) given a countable Borel equivalence relation E, E is
the orbit equivalence relation of a (discontinuous) action of Z.
It is an interesting question whether some of the statements above can be com-
bined; in general, we have

We give a similar treatment to certain other well-known quotient cardinal in-
equalities. For example,
