poset P by Theorem 8.1.2. The sequence (cid:104)p¯ : n ≤ ω(cid:105) is

have a nonzero rational distance.

226 CHAPTER 9. PRESERVING CARDINALITIES
1. In the P -extension of the symmetric Solovay model, the orbit divide is
Γ
preserved;
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
chromatic number of Γ is countable, and the orbit divide is preserved.
Example 9.4.26. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ. Let
P be the 3-Hamel decomposition forcing of Definition 8.1.11. The poset P is
nested balanced.
Proof. LetJ betheidealonωfromwhichtheposetP isconstructed. Letp∈P
be any condition. Let (cid:104)M : n≤ω(cid:105) be a generic choice-coherent sequence such
n
that for every n∈ω, the set 2ω∩M \M is nonempty. Let ≺ be a coherent
n n+1
well-orderingofallfunctionsfromX toω. Let{a : n≤ω}∈V beacollection
n
(cid:83)
of pairwise disjoint infinite sets such that a ∈J. Use Claim 8.1.14 in each
n n
model M to show that in M , there is a 3-Hamel decomposition extending p
n n
suchthatallpointsnotindom(p)getacolorintheseta ;letd bethe≺-least
n n
such a coloring. Now, working in M , let c : X → ω be the map defined by
n n
c (x)=d (x) if x∈M , and c (x)=d (x) if x∈M \M .
n ω ω n m m m+1
We claim that c is a 3-Hamel decomposition. To see this, suppose that
n
x ,x ,x are distinct nonzero points points in a nontrivial linear combination
0 1 2
resulting in 0. Let m ≤ ω be the largest index such that one of the points,
say x , is in M . Either all three points are in M but not in M and
0 m m m+1
then the triple is not monochromatic as d is a Γ-coloring. Or, the other two
m
points are in M \M for some k <m. In such a case the triple is again not
k k+1
monochromatic: either x ∈ dom(p) and then the failure of monochromaticity

and then c (x )∈a and c (x )∈a and the sets a ,a are disjoint.

Now, it is not difficult to see that (cid:104)c : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a coherent sequence of
n
3-Hamel decompositions. A 3-Hamel decomposition is a balanced condition for
P by Theorem ??. Finally, p ≥ c ≥ ··· ≥ c ≥ c ≥ c holds in the poset P

as the sets a for n≤ω all belong to the ideal J. Thus, (cid:104)M ,c : n≤ω(cid:105) is the
n n n
required nest below the condition p.
Corollary 9.4.27. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ. Let
P be the 3-Hamel decomposition forcing of Definition 8.1.11.
1. Let P be the 3-Hamel decomposition forcing. In the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, the orbit divide is preserved;
2. itisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is 3-Hamel decomposition of X, and the orbit divide is preserved.
In view of Example 8.1.15 it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal
that ZF+DC holds, the orbit divide is preserved, and there is a decomposition
of R2 into countably many pieces neither of which contains the vertices of an
equilateral triangle.
