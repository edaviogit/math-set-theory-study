336 CHAPTER 13. THE ARITY DIVIDE
Proof. To start with, note that Q×Q forces σ and σ to be compatible
left right
virtual conditions in P by the balance assumption on p¯, and it also forces η
left
and η to be E-unrelated elements of X by the pinned assumption on the
right
equivalence relation E. Let (cid:104)q ,q (cid:105) ∈ H ,q ∈ H be conditions and suppose

towards a contradiction that in M, the condition (cid:104)q ,q (cid:105) forces the negation of

the statement of the claim.
Let λ<κ be a cardinal larger than |P(Q)∩M| and let K ,K ⊂Coll(ω,λ)

be filters mutually generic over M[H ,H ]. By (*) and the forcing theorem,

there are filters H(cid:48) ∈ M[H ][K ] and H(cid:48) ∈ M[H ][K ] which are generic over

M, q ∈H(cid:48) and q ∈H(cid:48) holds, and moreover, writing x(cid:48) =η/H(cid:48), x(cid:48) =η/H(cid:48),

p¯(cid:48) = σ/H(cid:48) and p¯(cid:48) = σ/H(cid:48), we have that x E x(cid:48) and x E x(cid:48) both hold, and

Now, observe that the conditions p¯ ,p¯(cid:48),p¯ ,p¯(cid:48) have a common lower bound

in the poset P. To see this, note that p¯ ,p¯(cid:48) are compatible with a lower bound
