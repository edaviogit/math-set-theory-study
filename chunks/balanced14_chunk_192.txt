choice: the poset Q of all infinite countable almost disjoint families ordered by
reverse inclusion. However, the following remains open:
Question 8.9.9. Is the poset Q weakly balanced?

This has a number of cardinality corollaries for the resulting extensions. The
following theorem is stated in terms of Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 9.1.1. In cofinally balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model W, every well-ordered sequence of elements of W belongs to W.
Proof. LetP beaSuslinforcing. LetκbeaninaccessiblecardinalsuchthatP is
balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model derived from
κandworkinW. Foraformulaφofthelanguageofsettheory,elementy ∈2ω,
and a set v ∈ V, write u(φ,y,v) for the unique set x such that W |= φ(x,y,v)
if such a unique x exists; otherwise, write u(φ,y,v) = 0. Suppose towards a

that p forces τ to be an α-sequence of elements of W which does not belong
to W. The name τ is definable from some real parameter z ∈ 2ω and some
elements of the ground model. Find an intermediate model V[K] which is an
extension of the ground model by a poset of size <κ such that p,z ∈V[K] and
P is balanced in V[K].
Work in V[K]. Let p¯be a balanced virtual condition in P below p. Since
in W, τ is forced not to belong to W, there must be in V[K] an ordinal β ∈α
