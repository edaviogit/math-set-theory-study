3.4 Examples and operations
The extent of the classes of placid and virtually placid equivalence relations is
best explored using the following closure theorems.
Theorem 3.4.1. The class of placid equivalence relations is closed under the
following operations:
1. Borel almost reduction;
2. countable product;
3. countable increasing union;
4. countable factor;
The class of virtually placid equivalence relations is closed under the same op-
erations and the Friedman–Stanley jump.
Proof. In view of Proposition 3.3.4, it is enough to show the closure of virtual
placidity under these operations, since the class of pinned equivalence relations
is closed under (1–4) by the work of Chapter 2. For virtual placidity, we will
prove (1) and the closure under the Friedman–Stanley jump.

X,Y and h: X → Y is a Borel function which is a reduction of E to Y every-
where except for a set Z ⊂X consisting of countably many E-classes. Suppose
that F is virtually placid and work towards the conclusion that E is virtually
placid. Let V[H ], V[H ] be generic extensions such that V[H ]∩V[H ] = V

and let x ∈V[H ] and x ∈V[H ] be E-related points in X; we need to show

that they are realizations of some virtual E-class in V. If x ∈ Z then this

certainly occurs as V contains a countable set of points whose E-classes cover
Z, and this feature of the countable set persists to V[H ] by a Shoenfield abso-

argument, Q(cid:13)∃x∈X\Z h(x)E σ; letτ beaQ-nameforsuchapointx∈X.
It is not difficult to see that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is an E-pin and x ,x realize the virtual
