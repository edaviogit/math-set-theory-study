adding an injection π: κ → X which is a
homomorphism of ¬T to ¬R.
Theorem2.5.35. LetX beaPolishspace. Thereisacombinatoriallyuniversal
Borel equivalence relation on [X]<ℵ0 with countably many classes.

2.5. CARDINAL INVARIANTS 61
Proof. Without loss of generality assume X = [ω]ℵ0. Consider the following
relation R on [X]<ℵ0. Define a Borel function g: [X]<ℵ0 → [ω]<ℵ0 by g(a) =
{min(x\m+1): x∈a} if a is a set of size at least two and consists of pairwise
almost disjoint sets and m is the largest number which appears in at least two
of them; g(a) = min(x) if a = {x} is a singleton; and otherwise g(a) = 0. Let
R be the equivalence relation induced by the function g. We will show that R
is universal.
Letκbeacardinal,T anequivalencerelationon[κ]<ℵ0 withcountablymany
classes, and let f: [κ]<ℵ0 → ω be a map inducing the equivalence relation T.
Let ν: [ω]<ℵ0 → ω be a sufficiently generic map such that ν(g(0)) = f(0). Let
P be the poset of all maps p such that
• dom(p)⊂κ is a finite set;
• for every α∈dom(p) the value p(α) is a nonempty subset of ω;
• for every α∈dom(p), ν(min(p(α)))=f(α);
• foreveryseta⊂dom(p)ofsizeatleast2thereisanumberwhichbelongs

such number, p(α)\m+1 (cid:54)= 0 holds for every α ∈ a, and ν({min(p(α)\
m+1): α∈a})=f(a).
Theorderingisdefinedbyq ≤pifforeveryα∈dom(p),q(α)end-extendsp(α),
and the sets q(α)\p(α) are pairwise disjoint for α∈dom(p).
Claim 2.5.36. P is c.c.c.
Proof. In fact, P is semi-Cohen in the sense of [4], but we will not need that
fact here. By the usual ∆-system arguments, it is enough to show that any
two conditions p,q ∈P such that p(cid:22)dom(p)∩dom(q)=q (cid:22)dom(p)∩dom(q),
are compatible. To find the lower bound, enumerate dom(p)∪dom(q) as β for

i ∈ k, enumerate (dom(p)\dom(q))×(dom(q)\dom(p)) as u for j ∈ l. Use
