using the following claims:
Claim 11.2.13. Let P,Q be very Suslin c.c.c. posets. Then
1. P ∗Q˙ is a very Suslin c.c.c. poset;
2. the iteration maps are analytic and form a projection from P ∗Q˙ to P.

Proof. This is a routine complexity calculation. The underlying set P ∗Q˙ is
analytic by Proposition 11.2.9, since p (cid:13) q˙ ∈ Q˙ is an analytic statement. The
ordering on P ∗Q˙ is analytic for the same reason. To check the analyticity
of the incompatibility relation, observe that conditions (cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105) and (cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105) are
0 0 1 1
incompatible just in case there is a (countable) maximal antichain A⊂P such
thatforeveryp∈A, eitherpisincompatiblewithp , oritisincompatiblewith
0
p , or it is below both p ,p , and in the latter case, p(cid:13)q˙ ,q˙ are incompatible
1 0 1 0 1
in the poset Q˙. This is an analytic statement by Proposition 11.2.9 and the
assumption that the incompatibility relation on Q is analytic.
The poset P ∗Q˙ is c.c.c. because Q˙ remains c.c.c. in the P-extension by
Fact 11.2.2 and so P ∗ Q˙ is an iteration of two c.c.c. forcings. Finally, we
have to check that for a countable set B = {(cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105): n ∈ ω} ⊂ P ∗Q˙, the
n n
statement that B is predense is analytic. To see this, let Z be the Polish

formula φ: there exists a name τ for an element of Zω and maximal antichains

force τ(n)=q˙ , if they are incompatible with p then they force τ(n)=0, and

P
is analytic by Proposition 11.2.9, and that it says that 1 (cid:13) {q˙ : p belongs

to the generic filter} is predense in Q˙, which is exactly equivalent to the set B
being predense in P ∗Q˙.

Claim 11.2.14. Suppose that (cid:104)P : n ∈ ω,π ,ξ : m ≤ n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a very
n nm mn
Suslin system. The limit P is a very Suslin c.c.c. forcing. The limit maps π
ω ωm
and ξ form analytic projections and commute with the projection maps of the
mω
very Suslin system.
Proof. This is a straightforward complexity computation. Let X be the ambi-

entPolishspaceofeachposetP ; theambientspaceoftheposetP isthenthe
n ω
(cid:83)
disjoint union X in product with ω. The ordering of P is analytic by the
n n ω
definition. The incompatibility relation is analytic as well: suppose that (cid:104)q,n(cid:105)
and (cid:104)p,m(cid:105) are conditions in P , say with n ≥ m. These two conditions are
ω
incompatible just in case π (q) is incompatible with p in P by the definitory
nm m
properties of projections.
The poset P is c.c.c. since it is a direct limit of c.c.c. forcings. To check
ω
the very Suslin property of the poset P , note that a countable set A ⊂ P is
ω ω
predense if and only if for every number n ∈ ω, there is a maximal antichain
B ⊂ P of conditions such that for each p ∈ B , either there is a condition
n ω n
(cid:104)q,m(cid:105) ∈ A such that m ≤ n and π (p) ≤ q in P , or there is a condition
nm m
(cid:104)q,m(cid:105) ∈ A such that m ≥ n and p ≤ π (q) in P . This is an analytic

statement as all the posets P are very Suslin.
