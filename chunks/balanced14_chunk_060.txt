Theorem2.5.29. LetX beaPolishspace. Thereisacombinatoriallyuniversal
Borel relation on [X]<ℵ0 ×X with countable vertical sections.

2.5. CARDINAL INVARIANTS 59
Proof. Let X =P(ω). We will show that the relation R⊂[X]<ℵ0 ×X defined
by (cid:104)a,x(cid:105)∈R if x is computable from a is universal. Let κ be a cardinal and let
T ⊂ [κ]n ×κ be a relation with countable vertical sections. Let (cid:104)k : m ∈ ω(cid:105)
m
be a recursive sequence of increasing functions in ωω with disjoint ranges. For
(cid:84)
a finite set b ⊂ P(ω) let e be the increasing enumeration of the set b, for
b
every m∈ω let h (b)⊂P(ω) be the set of all l ∈ω such that e ◦k (l) is an
m b m
oddnumber. We will produce a forcingwhichadds an injection π: κ→X such
that for every finite set a⊂κ and every α∈T , there is a number m∈ω such
a
that π(α) is modulo finite equal to h (π(cid:48)(cid:48)a).

Let P be the poset of all tuples p=(cid:104)n ,π ,ν (cid:105) so that
p p p
• n ∈ω,π isapartialfunctionfromκtoP(n )withfinitedomaindom(p);

• ν is a finite partial function from P(dom(p))×ω to dom(p) such that
p
(a,ν (a,m))∈T whenever (cid:104)a,m(cid:105)∈dom(ν ).
p p
The ordering on P is defined by q ≤ p if n ≤ n , dom(p) ⊂ dom(q),
p q
∀α ∈ dom(p) π (α) = π (α)∩n , ν ⊂ ν , and for every (cid:104)a,m(cid:105) ∈ dom(ν ),

whenever l is a number in the domain of (e \e )◦k then e ◦k (l) is

q q q
odd if and only if l∈π (ν (a,m)). It is not difficult to see that P is indeed an
q p
ordering.
Claim 2.5.30. The poset P is c.c.c.
Proof. Let (cid:104)p : α∈ω (cid:105) be conditions in P. The usual ∆-system and counting
α 1
arguments can be used to thin down the collection if necessary so that the sets
dom(p ) for α ∈ ω form a ∆-system with root b and for all a ∈ [b]n and
α 1
all α ∈ ω , T ∩dom(p ) ⊂ b. Moreover, we can require that the increasing
1 a α
bijection between dom(p ) and dom(p ) extends to an isomorphism of p and
α β α
p for every α,β ∈ω .

Proof. Let p ∈ P; we must find a condition q ≤ p in the set D . For defi-
