poset. Moreover,
1. for every total Γ-coloring c: X →ω the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105) is balanced;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a total coloring c such that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is
equivalent to (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105);
3. distinct colorings yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Γ
Proof. Fixawell-ordering≺onthespaceX suchthatforeveryelementx∈X,
the set {y ∈ X: y ≺ x and {x,y} ∈ Γ} is finite. We start with a humble
observation which will be used in several places below.
Claim 8.1.3. Let M be a countable elementary submodel of a large countable
structure containing ≺. Then every y ∈ X \M is Γ-connected with at most
finitely many elements of X∩M.
Proof. Suppose that y ∈ X \M is a point. Then for every x ∈ M ≺-greater
than y, {x,y} ∈/ Γ holds: if {x,y} ∈ Γ then y belongs to the finite set of all
points ≺-smaller than x and connected with x and by elementarity it would
have to belong to the model M, which is not the case. Thus, the only points of
M connected to y in Γ are ≺-smaller than y, and there are only finitely many
points like that by the definitory property of the ordering ≺.
Let P be the poset of all partial countable Γ-colorings p: X →ω such that
for all points y ∈ X \dom(p), the set {x ∈ dom(p): {x,y} ∈ Γ} is finite. The
ordering on P is that of reverse extension. The following two claims show that
P has the properties required in (1).
Claim 8.1.4. P is a Suslin ℵ -distributive poset.

Proof. We first need to show that the set of all (enumerations of) conditions in
P is Borel. Use Claim 8.1.3 to conclude that for every countable set a ⊂ X,
the set b = {y ∈ X: ∃∞x ∈ a {x,y} ∈ Γ} is countable. By the Lusin–Novikov
theorem,thereareBorelfunctions{f : i∈ω}fromXω toX suchthatforevery

with infinitely many points of rng(z). Now we can evaluate the complexity of
the set of enumerations of conditions in the poset P. A function r: ω →X×ω
is an enumeration of a condition in P just in case when rng(r) is a function
and a Γ-coloring, and, writing s: ω →X for the first component function of r,
for every i ∈ ω if f (s) is Γ-connected to infinitely many points in rng(s), then
i
f (s)∈rng(s). This is a Borel condition.

To show that the poset P is Suslin, note that two conditions p ,p ∈P are
0 1
compatible just in case they are compatible as functions: then p ∪p will be
0 1
their lower bound. To argue for the ℵ -distributivity, let p ∈ P be a condition
