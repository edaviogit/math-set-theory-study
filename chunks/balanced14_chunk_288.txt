Corollary 12.1.10. [21] Let P be the poset of infinite subsets of ω ordered by
inclusion.
1. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model, the full Silver di-
chotomy holds, and OCA+ holds.
2. ItisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is a Ramsey ultrafilter on ω, the full Silver dichotomy holds, and OCA+

Example 12.1.11. Let (cid:104)Γ,·(cid:105) be a countable semigroup. The poset P = P(Γ)
of Subsection 7.4 is perfect.
Proof. Recall that elements of P are just sequences in Γω and the ordering is
defined by q ≤p if there are pairwise disjoint nonempty finite sets a ⊂ω such

that q(n) = p(m). The proof of the perfect property of the poset P is

finite set b ⊂ 2ω, the conditions in the set f(cid:48)(cid:48)b have a common lower bound in
P; we must find a perfect set B ⊂ 2ω such that the set f(cid:48)(cid:48)B ⊂ P has a lower
bound.
Thinning the domain of f if necessary we may assume that the function f
is continuous. By induction on n∈ω build nodes u ∈2<ω for all t∈2n, finite
