Most of the central analytic hypergraphs in this section are in fact products
of hypergraphs on finite or countable domain. The following definition explains
the typical construction.

Definition 11.1.1. Let (cid:104)a ,H ,t : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a sequence such that a is a

nonempty countable (often finite) set, H is a hypergraph on a and t ∈

Let X = a and define:

b ⊂ X such that for some n ∈ ω, ∀m (cid:54)= n ∀x ,x ∈ b x (m) = x (m),

In all cases, the sets a are implicit in the notation. The definition of the
n
product (as opposed to the skew product) does not depend on the strings t .

Among the product graphs, the Hamming graphs are prominent.
Definition 11.1.2. Let n ≥ 2 be a natural number. H , the Hamming graph
n
on nω, is the product of infinitely many cliques of size n. H , the diagonal

product of infinitely many cliques on ω.
Skew products are useful as minimal examples of various phenomena. One
standard example is the uncountable Borel chromatic number of graphs:
Definition 11.1.3. Let G be an analytic hypergraph on a Polish space X. G
has countable Borel chromatic number if there are Borel G-anticliques B ⊂X

for n∈ω such that X = B .

Definition 11.1.4. For each n ∈ ω, let a = 2, let H be the graph on a
n n n
containing only the whole set a as an edge and let t ∈ 2n be a string such
n n
that {t : n∈ω}⊂2<ω is dense. The graph G is defined as (cid:81) H ,t .

Fact 11.1.5. [54](ZF+DC) For every analytic graph G on a Polish space X,
exactly one of the following occurs:
1. the Borel chromatic number of G is countable;
2. there is a continuous map from 2ω to X which is a homomorphism of G
0
to G.
Uncountable chromatic numbers of locally countable graphs can be used in
ZF+DC to rule out seemingly unrelated phenomena. The following humble
proposition will be useful at several points of this book:
Proposition 11.1.6. (ZF+DC) If the chromatic number of G is greater than
0
two then
1. there is no linear ordering of the E -quotient space;
