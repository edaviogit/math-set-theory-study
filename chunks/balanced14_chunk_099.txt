(cid:83) Y(cid:48))∩(C ∩ (cid:83) Y(cid:48)(cid:48)) (cid:54)= 0, contradicting the invariance of the sets Y(cid:48) and Y(cid:48)(cid:48)
under V2-connections.
Now, the V2-connected component Y found in the first paragraph must in

(cid:83)
fact be such that µ (C∩ (Y \Y ))<ε , by an argument identical to the one

in the previous paragraph with Y(cid:48) =Y and Y(cid:48)(cid:48) =Y \Y . This completes the

proof of the claim.
Letting Y(B) = Y completes the construction. The V2-connectedness is clear

from the choice of Y , the first item is clear from the choice of Y (B), and

Now, let D = B . The set D is closed as the d-balls in the sets B are
n n n
clopen. It is also a subset of C, because each of the balls in B has nonempty
n
intersection with C, and C is closed. The set D also has positive µ-mass; the
mass distribution of D is governed by the following claim:
Claim 3.6.7. For every n≥2 and every ball B ∈B , µ (D)>ε .

Proof. To get the set D∩B, we subtracted from C ∩B a set of size at most
Σ 2−mµ (C) by the second item above, so µ (D)>1/2µ (C)>ε by the

first item above.
Towards the connectedness of the set D, consider the following claim:
Claim3.6.8. Letm≤nbenaturalnumbers,B ∈B aball,andx ,x ∈B∩D
m 0 1
be any points. Then there is a U,δ -walk from x to x using only points in
n 0 1
B∩D.
Proof. This is proved by induction on n−m, which is the reason for the con-
voluted statement of the claim. The case n − m = 0 is trivial since then
d(x ,x ) < δ . Now suppose that the statement is known for m + 1 ≤ n
0 1 n
and proceed to show that it is also true for m ≤ n. Let B ,B ∈ B be
0 1 m+1
balls such that x ∈ B and x ∈ B . If B = B then the induction hypoth-

esis immediately applies. Otherwise, by the third item above, the set Y(B) is
V2-connected, so there must be a sequence of balls in Y(B) starting at B and
0
ending at B such that successive balls are V2-connected. Suppose for simplic-
1
ity that this sequence has length 2–i.e. B and B are V2-connected. Fix an
0 1
element γ ∈V2 such that γ·B =B .

Since µ (D) and µ (D) are both greater than ε , the concentration

assumption yields that the numbers µ (V ·(D∩B ))=µ (V ·(D∩B )) are

both greater than 1/2. It follows that there is a point x∈(V ·(D∩B ))∩B

such that γ·x∈(V ·(D∩B )). Find points x(cid:48) ∈D∩B and x(cid:48) ∈D∩B and
