Example 9.6.2. LetA⊂X =(2ω)ω bethesetofallelementsx∈X suchthat
rng(x) is linearly ordered by Turing reducibility, and let E =F(cid:22)A. Note that
the E-quotient space is classified by subsets of 2ω which are linearly ordered by
Turing reducibility. There are uncountable sets of this form, and therefore E is
unpinned. At the same time, such sets have size at most ℵ and so the virtual
1
E-quotientspace has size 2ℵ1.
Now, let P be the collapse of E = F2 (cid:22) A to |2ω|. The poset P is balanced
if and only if 2ℵ0 =2ℵ1 by Theorem 6.6.3; in particular, it is cofinally balanced
below any inaccessible cardinal. Thus, the P-extension of the Solovay model
is a cofinally balanced extension in which the (in ZFC) unpinned equivalence
relation E has the same cardinality as 2ω.

Uniformization
Thequestionwhethervariousformsofuniformizationholdinthemodelswithin
purview of this book is one of the more slippery issues we set out to resolve.
10.1 Tethered Suslin forcing
In order to prove all forms of uniformization in a clean sweep, the following
definition will be central.
Definition 10.1.1. LetP beaSuslinforcingandλbeaninfinitecardinal. The
poset P is λ-tethered if whenever V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic extensions
0 1
of V and p ∈ V[H ], p ∈ V[H ] are incompatible conditions, then there are
0 0 1 1
incompatiblevirtualconditionsp(cid:48),p(cid:48) ∈V representedonposetsofsize<λsuch
0 1
that p ,p(cid:48) are compatible and p ,p(cid:48) are compatible. The poset P is tethered if
0 0 1 1
it is λ-tethered for some cardinal λ.
One immediate corollary of tether is that it places an upper bound on the
number of balanced classes, which we do not know how to obtain in general.
Proposition 10.1.2. Let P be a Suslin forcing and λ be an infinite cardinal.
If P is λ-tethered then there are at most 22λ many balanced classes.
Proof. LetAbethesetofallvirtualconditionsofP representedonposetsofsize
