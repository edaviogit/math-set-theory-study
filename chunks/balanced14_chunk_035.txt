Proposition 1.7.8. Let n ∈ ω be a number and {P : i ∈ n} be posets. Let
i
{G : i ∈ n} be filters separately generic over the ground model V over the
i
respective posets. The following are equivalent:

1. G ⊂ P is a filter generic over V;

2. whenever {a : i ∈ n} are subsets of the ground model in the respective

models V[G ] such that a = 0 then there are sets {b : i ∈ n} in the

ground model V such that for all i∈n a ⊂b and b =0 holds.

Suppose now that (2) holds. To confirm (1), suppose towards a contradic-

consider the set a = {(cid:104)p : j ∈ n(cid:105) ∈ D: p ∈ G } ⊂ P . The contradictory

assumption gives that a = 0; the assumption (2) yields sets b ⊂ P in

a genericity argument shows that there must be a condition r ∈ G such that

every tuple (cid:104)p : i∈n(cid:105)∈D with p ≤r must in fact belong to the set b . Use

the density of the set D to find a tuple (cid:104)p : i ∈ n(cid:105) ∈ D such that for all i ∈ n,

p ≤ r holds. Then (cid:104)p : i ∈ n(cid:105) ∈ b , contradicting the choice of the sets b

Proposition 1.7.10. Let M be a countable transitive model of set theory and
P ∈ M be a poset. Then there is a continuous map h: 2ω → P(P) such that
for every finite set a ⊂ 2ω, the product (cid:81) h(x) is a filter on the poset P|a|
x∈a
generic over the model M.
Proof. Let (cid:104)D : n∈ω(cid:105) be an enumeration of all open dense subsets of various

finite powers of P which appear in the model M. By induction on m∈ω build
