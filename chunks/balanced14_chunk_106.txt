onsider the projection of Q to
R
P by setting π(p,r)=p and ξ(p)=(cid:104)p,1 (cid:105). An important effect of the demand
R
(3) is that the π-image of the generic filter on Q is a generic filter on P.

4.2. COHERENT SEQUENCES OF MODELS 107
Definition 4.2.7. Let (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) be a coherent sequence of models of ZFC.
n
A coherent sequence of posets is a sequence (cid:104)P ,π ,ξ : n ≤ m ∈ ω(cid:105) such
n nm mn
that
1. For all numbers n ≤ m the maps π : P → P and ξ : P → P
nm n m mn m n
form a projection of P to P ;
n m
2. the functions π form a commutative system, the same for ξ , and for
nm mn
all n∈ω the functions π ,ξ are the identity on P ;
nn nn n
3. for every number k ∈ ω, the sequence (cid:104)P ,π ,ξ : k ≤ n ≤ m ∈ ω(cid:105)
n nm mn
belongs to the model M .

In particular, every commutative sequence of projections is coherent over the
constant coherent sequence (cid:104)M =V : n∈ω(cid:105). As the simplest initial example,
n
let (cid:104)R : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a sequence of posets with respective largest elements 1 ,
n n
let P be the finite (or countable) support product of R for m ≥ n, and
n m
let π (p) = p (cid:22) [m,ω) and ξ (p) = (cid:104)1 : k ∈ [n,m)(cid:105)(cid:97)p. The sequence
nm nm k
(cid:104)P ,π ,ξ : n≤m∈ω(cid:105) is coherent over (cid:104)M =V : n∈ω(cid:105).

Theorem 4.2.8. Let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a coherent sequence of models of ZFC
n
and (cid:104)P ,π : P → P ,ξ : P → P : n ≤ m ∈ ω(cid:105) be a coherent sequence
n nm n m mn m n
of posets. Let G ⊂ P be a filter generic over M , and for each n ∈ ω let

G = ξ−1G. The sequence (cid:104)M [G ]: n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a coherent sequence of models

of ZFC again.
Proof. Observe that for every number k ∈ ω, in the model M [G ], one can

form the sequence (cid:104)G : n≥k(cid:105) as (cid:104)ξ−1G : n≥k(cid:105) by the commutativity of the

The critical object for understanding a coherent sequence of models is the in-
(cid:84)
tersection model M = M . In Example 4.2.2, the intersection model is a
ω n n
model of ZFC, and it has been discussed in [49, Theorem 9.3.4]; we will come
back to it below–Theorem 4.3.5. In the context of general coherent sequences,
the intersection model is a transitive model of ZF, and the Axiom of Choice
may fail in it. This is the content of the following theorem and example.
Theorem 4.2.9. If (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a coherent sequence of generic extensions

of V, then M = M is a class in all models M , and it is a model of ZF.
