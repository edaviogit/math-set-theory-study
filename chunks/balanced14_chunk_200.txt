are satisfied with the inherited topology.

Another class of examples stems from posets which select a single structure on
each E-class from a compact class of structures, where E is a countable Borel
equivalence relation.
Example 9.2.13. LetX beaPolishspaceandletΓbealocallyfinitebipartite
Borel graph on X satisfying the Hall’s marriage condition. Consider the poset
P adding a perfect Γ-matching as in Example 6.2.4. The balanced virtual
conditions are classified by perfect matchings. The set of perfect matchings is
naturally viewed as a compact subset of P(Γ). It is not difficult to check that
the inherited compact topology satisfies the demands of Definition 9.2.1.
Corollary 9.2.14. Let X be a Polish space and let Γ be a locally finite bipartite
Borel graph on X satisfying Hall’s marriage condition.

symmetric Solovay model, |E |>|2ω|;

has a perfect matching, and yet |E |>|2ω|.

Example 9.2.15. LetX beaPolishspaceandletΓbeaBorel,acyclic,locally
finite graph on X in which every vertex has degree at least 2; view Γ as a
symmetric subset of X2. Consider the poset P of Example 6.2.5, adding an
orientation of Γ in which every vertex has exactly one point in its outflow, or
in other words which selects an end to each connected component of Γ. The
balancedconditionsareclassifiedbyallsuchorientations,whichformacompact
subset of P(Γ). It is not difficult to check that the inherited compact topology
satisfies the demands of Definition 9.2.1.
This example is somewhat singular in that it is the only compactly balanced
poset for which we are able to confirm that it introduces some new cardinal
inequalities between quotient cardinals. Namely, writing E for the Γ-path-
connectednessequivalencerelation,intheP-extensionofthesymmetricSolovay
model |E| ≤ |E | must hold. To see this, consider the equivalence relation F
