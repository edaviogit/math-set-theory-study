It is not difficult to see that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is an E-pin and x ,x realize the virtual

3.4. EXAMPLES AND OPERATIONS 91
For the Friedman–Stanley jump, suppose that E is a virtually placid equiv-
alence relation on a Polish space X, V[H ] and V[H ] are separately generic
0 1
extensions of V such that V[H ]∩V[H ] = V and y ,y ∈ Xω are elements
0 1 0 1
in the respective models such that [rng(y )] = [rng(y )] . Since E is virtu-
0 E 1 E
ally placid, every element of rng(y ) is a realization of a virtual E-class from
0
V. Let B be the set of all virtual E-classes in V which have realizations in
rng(y ). Since B is also the set of all virtual E-classes in V which have real-
0
izations in rng(y ), it is clear that B ∈ V[H ]∩V[H ] = V. Thus, the points

y ,y ∈ Xω are realizations of the virtual E+-class represented by the set B.

By Proposition 3.3.3, we conclude that E+ is virtually placid.
Theorem 3.4.2. Suppose that Γ is a Polish group continuously acting on a
Polish space X and E is the resulting orbit equivalence relation. The following
are equivalent:
1. E is virtually placid;
2. for every Borel set B ⊂ X such that E (cid:22) B is Borel, E (cid:22) B is virtually
placid.
Proof. (1)immediatelyimplies(2)sinceE (cid:22)B isreducibletoE bytheidentity
map on B. Now suppose that (1) fails, and let P be a poset and τ be a name
for an element of X such that P × P (cid:13) τ E τ fails, and let Q be a
left right
poset with names H˙ , H˙ for filters generic over the ground model such that

Let M be a countable elementary submodel of a large structure containing
all objects mentioned so far. Let M¯ be the transitive collapse of M, and P¯,Q¯
etc. be the images of P,Q etc. under the transitive collapse map. By Proposi-
tion 3.5.5, Q¯ (cid:13) V[H¯ ]∩V[H¯ ] = V holds even in V (as opposed to M¯). Let
0 1
B = {x ∈ X: ∃H ⊂ P¯ generic over M¯ such that x = τ¯/H}. We have just
provedthatE (cid:22)B isnotvirtuallyplacid. Theproofiscompletedbyareference
to Corollary 2.8.8–the set B ⊂X is Borel and the equivalence relation E (cid:22)B is
Borel as well.
The theorem allows the transfer of the virtual placid property from Borel

Consider the following attractive corollary:
Corollary 3.4.3. Every equivalence relation classifiable by countable structures
is virtually placid.
Proof. InviewofTheorem3.4.1(1),itisonlynecessarytoshowthateveryorbit
equivalence relation E obtained from an action of S is virtually placid. By

Theorem 3.4.2, it is only necessary to show that all Borel fragments of E are
virtually placid. To this end, consider the transfinite sequence (cid:104)F : α ∈ ω (cid:105)
