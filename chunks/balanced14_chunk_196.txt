Now, we are ready to show that 2ω ⊂ M. Suppose that x ∈ 2ω is a point.
Since M contains uncountably many elements of 2ω, there must be distinct

The definition seems to be obscure at the first reading, but it is fully justified
by the natural compact Hausdorff topologies present in the examples. One
rather (intentionally) unclear feature is the definability of the topology T. It
is central in that otherwise the definition would have no content and the key
item (3) could not be stated without it. The definition is allowed to have real
parameters. However, the nature of the definition of T is left undetermined.
In the examples, the topology T is typically nonseparable, and the compact
Hausdorff space (cid:104)B,T(cid:105) can be in principle very complicated. The following
