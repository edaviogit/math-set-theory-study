9.3 The turbulent divide
We wish to transfer the ergodicity theorem 3.3.5 to cardinal inequalities in
generic extensions of the Solovay model. The following variation of balance will
be central in this effort.
Definition 9.3.1. Let P be a Suslin forcing.
1. A pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is placid if Q (cid:13) τ ⊂ P is an analytic set and whenever
R ,R are posets and in some ambient forcing extension, H ⊂ R ×Q
0 1 0 0
and H ⊂R ×Q are filters separately mutually generic over V such that

in the respective models V[H ],V[H ] are compatible in P.

2. The poset P is placid if below every condition p ∈ P there is a virtual
condition p¯≤p which is placid.
As an initial example, consider the poset P of countable functions from 2ω to 2
ordered by reverse inclusion. The balanced virtual conditions are classified by
totalfunctionsfrom2ω to2. Itturnsoutthateverysuchavirtualconditionp¯is

and p ∈ V[H ] and p ∈ V[H ] are conditions stronger than p¯, then p ∪

p is a function since dom(p )\V and dom(p )\V are disjoint sets and the
1 0 1
functions p ,p agree on the entries from V. Therefore, the conditions p ,p
0 1 0 1
are compatible as desired.
Placid posets share many preservation properties. The following theorems are
statedusingthestandardConvention1.7.16. Thefirsttheoreminadditionuses
a standard parlance.

the following statement: Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish

Theorem9.3.3. IncofinallyplacidextensionsofthesymmetricSolovaymodel,
the turbulent divide is preserved.
Proof. Let Γ be a Polish group, turbulently acting on a Polish space X, result-
ing in the equivalence relation E. Let F be a virtually placid orbit equivalence
relation on a Polish space Y. Let P be a Suslin forcing and let κ be an inac-
