3.1 Independent functions
The purpose of this section is to find a practical way of producing many exten-

poset P consists of nonempty open subsets of X ordered by inclusion; x˙ is

its name for the unique element of X belonging to all open sets in the generic
filter.
Proposition 3.1.1. Let X,Y be Polish spaces and f: X →Y be a continuous
open function. Then P forces f(x˙ ) to be a P -generic element of Y.

Proof. It is just necessary to show that for every open dense set D ⊂Y, P (cid:13)

f(x˙ )∈D holds. Tothisend,letO ∈P beacondition. Thesetf(cid:48)(cid:48)O ⊂Y is

open; therefore, it has nonempty intersection with D. Consider the nonempty
open set O(cid:48) = (f−1(f(cid:48)(cid:48)O∩D))∩O ⊂ O. For every point x ∈ O(cid:48), f(x) ∈ D
holds, so O(cid:48) (cid:13)f(x˙ )∈D as required.
