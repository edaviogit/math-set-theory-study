following.
Proposition 12.2.2. Let P be a Suslin poset and let p¯be a Bernstein balanced
condition in P. Let Q be a partial order and σ a Q-name for a condition in P
strongerthanp¯. Let W bea Solovay model derivedfrom aninaccessible cardinal
greater than κ. In the model W, if H ⊂ P(Q) is a perfect family consisting of
filters mutually generic over V, then p¯ forces in P that the set {H ∈ H: σ/H
belongs to the P-generic filter} is uncountable.
Proof. Work in the model W. Let p ∈ P be a condition stronger than p¯, and
a ⊂ H be a countable set. We must find a filter H ∈ H\a such that σ/H is
compatible with p. Let V[K] be an intermediate extension obtained by a poset
of cardinality smaller than κ containing a code for H, and enumeration of the
seta,andtheconditionQ. WorkinthemodelV[K]. ThesetH\aisBoreland
uncountable, and therefore contains a perfect subset. By the Bernstein balance
of the virtual condition p¯, there is a filter H ∈H\a such that p is compatible
withallconditionsinP∩V[H]strongerthanp¯,inparticularwiththecondition
σ/H. This concludes the proof.
With the proposition in hand, we begin a line of preservation results. They are
all stated using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 12.2.3. In cofinally Bernstein balanced extensions of the symmetric
Solovay model, there is no finitely additive diffuse probability measure on ω.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset which is
Bernstein balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ and work in the model W. Suppose towards a contradiction
that p ∈ P is a condition, τ is a P-name for a map from P(ω) to [0,1], and p
forces τ to be a finitely additive diffuse probability measure. The condition p
and the name τ are definable from ground model parameters and an additional
parameter z ∈2ω. Find an intermediate model V[K] obtained using a poset of
cardinality smaller than κ such that z ∈ V[K] and P is Bernstein balanced in
V[K]. Work in the model V[K].
Let p¯ ≤ p be a Bernstein balanced virtual condition. Let Q be the poset
of finite binary strings ordered by reverse end-extensions, with its name x˙ for
the set of those n ∈ ω for which there is a condition q ∈ Q in the generic
filter such that q(n) = 1. There must be a poset R of cardinality smaller
than κ, a condition (cid:104)q,r(cid:105) ∈ P ×R, and a Q×R-name σ for a condition in P
stronger than p¯ such that either (cid:104)q,r(cid:105) (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ(x˙) ≥ 1/2 or
P
(cid:104)q,r(cid:105) (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ(x˙) ≤ 1/2. For definiteness, assume that the
P
former option prevails; with the latter option, replace x˙ with the name for its
complement and proceed in the same way.
Move to an extension V[K][G] obtained with some poset of cardinality
smaller than κ such that P(Q×R)∩V[K] is countable in V[K][G], and work
in the model V[K][G]. Let (cid:104)O : m ∈ ω(cid:105) be an enumeration of all open dense
m
subsets of all finite powers of Q×R that appear in the model V[K], with infi-
nite repetitions. By recursion on m∈ω build numbers n ∈ω and conditions
