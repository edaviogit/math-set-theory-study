of the example it will be enough for an arbitrary condition p ∈ P ∩V to find
sets A ⊂ G for m ≤ ω forming an inclusion-descending sequence such that

The following elusive claim is the main reason for the choice of the posets Q .

If x ,x are connected by a path in the graph G(cid:22)X , then they are connected

Proof. It will be enough to show that if x ,x are connected by a path in the
0 1
graph G(cid:22)X whose vertices except for x ,x all belong to X , then they are
ln 0 1 lm
connected by a path in the graph G (cid:22) X . To this end, work in M and let

every element of a would reconstruct a over the model M [c]. Therefore, no

Let ≺ be a coherent well-ordering of all subsets of G in M . Let A ⊂ G

be a maximal acyclic subset of G in the model M such that p ⊂ A . For

each m ∈ ω, let A ∈ M be the ≺-first set in the model M which is a

maximal acyclic subset of G(cid:22)X and extends A .

Now, by induction on n−m, for m<n define A ∈M to be the ≺-first

Choose an inclusion-maximal contiguous part d ⊂ c of the cycle consisting of
edges in A \A . The end-nodes of d, denote them by x ,x , must

It must also be the case that x ,x ∈ X ∩X = X . The

they have to be connected by a path in the graph G (cid:22) X as well, and
