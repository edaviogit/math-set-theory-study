space, A ⊂ X is a set, and Γ is a graph on A which is open in the topology
on A×A inherited from X ×X, then either A is a union of countably many
Γ-anticliques, or A contains an uncountable Γ-clique.

308 CHAPTER 12. THE SILVER DIVIDE
Theorem 12.2.5. In cofinally Bernstein balanced extensions of the symmetric
Solovay model, OCA holds.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin forcing such that P
is Bernstein balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ. In the model W, let X be a Polish space and let Γ ⊂ X2 be
a symmetric open set, let p ∈ P be a condition, and let τ be a P-name for a
subsetofX suchthatp(cid:13)τ cannotbecoveredbycountablymanyΓ-anticliques.
We will find a perfect set C ⊂ X such that any two points of C are Γ-related,
and a condition q ≤p in P which forces Cˇ∩τ is uncountable.
To this end, choose a parameter z ∈ 2ω such that p,τ,Γ are definable from
z. Find an intermediate generic extension V[K] of V by a poset of size < κ
such that z ∈ V[K] and P is Bernstein balanced in V[K]. Work in the model
V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a Bernstein balanced virtual condition. Since Coll(ω,<
κ) (cid:13) p (cid:13) τ is not covered by countably many Γ-anticliques, and a closure
P
of a Γ-anticlique is still a Γ-anticlique, there must be a poset R of size < κ,
and R-name η for an element of X which belongs to no closed Γ-anticlique

The construction is routine except for the last item; we just describe how the
last item is obtained. Suppose that r has been found. Work in V[K] and let
t
U ⊂ X be the union of all basic open sets O ⊂ X such that r (cid:13) η ∈/ O. Then
t
r (cid:13) η ∈ X \ U. Since the set X \ U is closed, by the choice of the name
t
η it cannot be a Γ-anticlique and therefore there are points x ,x ∈ X \ U
0 1
which are Γ-connected. Since the set Γ⊂X2 is open, there are basic open sets
O ,O ⊂X such that x ∈O , x ∈O , and O ×O ⊂Γ. Neither of the
t0 t1 0 t0 1 t1 t0 t1
two open sets is a subset of U and therefore there must be conditions r and
t(cid:97)0
r below r such that the former forces η ∈O and the latter forces η ∈O
t(cid:97)1 t t0 t1
as desired.
In the end, for every binary sequence y ∈ 2ω let H ⊂ R be the filter
y
generated by the conditions {r y(cid:22)n : n ∈ ω} and let p y = σ/H y . Note that any
finite tuple of distinct filters H for y ∈ 2ω is mutually generic over the model
y
V[K]bytheseconditemintheinductiveconstructionabove. Proposition12.2.2
applied in V[K] shows that in W, p¯ forces the set a = {y ∈ 2ω: p is in the
y
generic filter} to be uncountable. The set {η/H : y ∈ a} is then forced to be
y
an uncountable Γ-clique.
