The assumption that C contains no straight segments is necessary in Theo-
rem 3.2.8. Suppose that C is a line passing through the origin and argue that
the projection functions are not independent. To see this, consider the P -

generic pair (cid:104)u ,u (cid:105). The line in the direction of C through u passes through

u and vice versa. Let B be the collection of all basic open subsets of R2 which

(cid:83)
have empty intersection with this line; thus, B ∈ V[u ]∩V[u ]. The set B
0 1
is open dense in R2 and contains neither u nor u . Since u ,u are Cohen-
0 1 0 1
generic points, they meet all open dense subsets of R2 coded in the ground
model; it follows that B ∈/ V. By Theorem 3.1.4, the projection functions are
not independent.

ducibility results and cardinal preservation results in the generic extensions of
the Solovay model. To state these results succinctly, the following definitions
are helpful.

In other words, an equivalence relation E is placid if disjoint generic extensions
do not share any E-classes which are not represented in V. An equivalence
relation E is virtually placid if disjoint generic extensions do not share any
