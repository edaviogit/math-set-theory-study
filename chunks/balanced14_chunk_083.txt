A (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ or A (cid:13) αˇ ∈/ τ . Once this is proved, let O(cid:48) = O∩f−1A and note

open sets B ,B ⊂ A such that B (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ and B (cid:13) αˇ ∈/ τ . Let (cid:104)x : i ≤ k(cid:105)

be a walk of points in O such that f (x ) ∈ B and f (x ) ∈ B . Let U =

(cid:83) {U: U ⊂ X and U (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ } and U = (cid:83) {U: U ⊂ X and U (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ }. By

the claim, there must be a walk of open sets (cid:104)O : i ≤ k(cid:105) such that each set O

is a subset of O, O ⊂f−1B , O ⊂f−1B , and each O is either disjoint from
0 0 0 k 0 1 i
or a subset of U , and either disjoint from or a subset of U . This means in
0 1
particular that each O decides both statements αˇ ∈τ and αˇ ∈τ .

Now, since O (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ and O (cid:13) αˇ ∈/ τ , there must be a number i ∈ k
0 0 k 0
such that O (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ and O (cid:13) αˇ ∈/ τ . It then must be the case that

f(cid:48)(cid:48)O ,f(cid:48)(cid:48)O ⊂Y aredisjoint;therefore,thesetsf(cid:48)(cid:48)O ,f(cid:48)(cid:48)O ⊂Y areequal.

This means that the sets O ,O must either both force αˇ ∈ τ or both force

αˇ ∈/ τ . In conclusion, one of the sets O ,O forces τ (cid:54)=τ , a contradiction.

Claim 3.1.6. The orbit of f (x) is nowhere dense in Y .

Proof. If the orbit were dense in some nonempty open set B ⊂Y , then in the

groundmodel,thesetB wouldshowthatOisnotawitnesstothefailureof(1).
Toseethis,supposethatB ,B ⊂B arenonemptyopensubsetsofB. Working

in V[x], find walks w ,w in O which lead from f (x) to B and B , invert w

and concatenate with w and get a walk from B to B . By the Mostowski

absoluteness between V[x] and V, there must be such a walk in V as well.

Claim 3.1.7. A∈V[f (x)]∩V[f (x)].
0 1
Proof. In V[x], the set A is defined as the set of all basic open sets B ⊂ Y
0
such that there is no walk (cid:104)x : i ≤ 2k(cid:105) in O such that f (x ) = f (x) and
i 0 0 0
f (x ) ∈ B. This is a Π1 definition with parameter f (x) which therefore
0 2k 1 0
yields the same set in the model V[f (x)].
0
In V[x], the same set A also has an alternative definition: it is the set of
all basic open sets B ⊂ Y such that there is no walk (cid:104)x : i ≤ 2k(cid:105) in O such
0 i
that f (x ) = f (x) and f (x ) ∈ B. To see this, note that a walk with
1 0 1 0 2k
f (x ) = f (x) can be transformed into a walk with f (x ) = f (x) (and also
0 0 0 1 0 1
vice versa) by simply adding the point x twice to the beginning of the walk.
This alternative definition of the set A is again Π1 with parameter f (x), so
1 1
Mostowski absoluteness yields the same set in the model V[f (x)].
