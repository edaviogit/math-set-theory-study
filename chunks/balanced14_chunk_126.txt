Chapter 6
Simplicial complex forcings
6.1 Basic concepts
Many examples of σ-closed Suslin partially ordered sets in this book are pre-
sented in the same way:
Definition 6.1.1. Let X be a set.
1. A set K of finite subsets of X is a simplicial complex if it is closed under
subset;
2. a set A ⊂ X is a K-set if [A]<ℵ0 ⊂ K. It is maximal if it is not a proper
subset of another K-set;
3. the poset P ⊂Xω consists of countable K-sets ordered by reverse inclu-
K
sion;
4. A˙ is the P -name for the union of all sets in the generic filter.

Nearly every poset considered in this book can be presented as a poset of
the form P for a Borel simplicial complex K on a Polish space X. Namely,
K
for a poset Q let K be the simplicial complex of the finite subsets of Q which
have a common lower bound. Under suitable assumptions on definability and
existence of lower bounds (which are invariably satisfied), the posets Q and
P are naturally forcing equivalent. However, this point of view rarely brings
K
any new insight. In this chapter, we deal with simplicial complexes that are
