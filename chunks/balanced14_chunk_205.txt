tion 12.2 based on the observation (Example 12.2.8) that placid forcings are
included in the much wider class of Bernstein balanced forcings.
It is now time to provide a long but not exhaustive list of examples with
their associated corollaries.

Corollary 9.3.6. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ.
1. Let P be the poset of countable subsets of X linearly independent over
Φ, ordered by reverse inclusion–Example 6.4.9. In the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, the turbulent divide is preserved;
2. it is consistent relatively to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, X
has a basis, and yet the turbulent divide is preserved.
Corollary 9.3.7. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X.
1. Let P be the poset of acyclic countable subsets of Γ, ordered by reverse
inclusion–Example 6.4.10. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay
model, the turbulent divide is preserved;
2. it is consistent relatively to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
Γ contains a maximal acyclic subgraph, and yet the turbulent divide is
preserved.
Example 9.3.8. Suppose that E,F are Borel virtually placid equivalence re-
lations on the respective Polish spaces X,Y. Suppose that λ(E)≤λ(F). Then
the E,F-collapse poset of Definition 6.6.2 is placid, and every balanced condi-
tion is placid.
