The following claim is central.
Claim 13.2.8. There is a symmetric tuple (cid:104)M,p¯,Q,η,σ(cid:105).
Proof. LetG⊂P beafiltergenericoverthemodelW containingtheconditionp

definable from parameters in the ground model and the additional parameters
z,c,G. There must be an E-class c such that c∩M =0; otherwise, one could

form an E-selector in W[G] as the set A = {x ∈ X: x is the least element of
[x] inthecanonicalwell-orderofM }, contradictingtheinitialassumptions

on the condition p. Fix such an E-class c, an arbitrary element x ∈ c, and let
M be the model of sets hereditarily definable from parameters in the ground
x
model and the additional parameters z,x,G. Note that M ⊂M holds.

generic extension of M by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ. By the tether
c
assumption, as in Proposition ???, there are virtual balanced conditions p¯ and
c
p¯ in the respective models M and M such that their realizations belong to
x c x
the generic filter G. Necessarily p¯ ≤ p¯ ≤ p holds. Working in M , let Q be
x c c
a poset of cardinality smaller than κ such that there is a filter H ⊂ Q generic
over M such that M = M [H]. Let η ∈M be a Q-name such that x = η/H
c x c c
and let σ be a Q-name such that p¯ =σ/H. We claim that for some condition
x
q ∈Q, the tuple (cid:104)M,p¯ ,Q(cid:22)q,η,σ(cid:105) is symmetric.
c
To see this, in W[G] let D ⊂ Q be the set of all conditions r ∈ Q such
that there is a filter H(cid:48) ⊂ Q which is generic over M and such that η/H(cid:48) ∈ c
c
and σ/H(cid:48) has a realization in the filter G. The set, having just been defined
from c and G, belongs to the model M . It also contains the Q-generic filter
c
H ⊂ Q as a subset. By a density argument with the filter H, there must be a
condition q ∈ H such that D contains all conditions r ∈ Q such that r ≤ q. It
is immediate from the definition of the set D that the condition q ∈Q works as
required.
Now, fix the symmetric tuple (cid:104)M,p¯,Q,η,σ(cid:105). Let H ⊂Q and H ⊂Q be

filters mutually generic over M, and write x = η/H , x = η/H , p¯ = σ/H

and p¯ =σ/H .
