Now,letK ⊂RbeafiltergenericoverthemodelV[G]andletH =τ/K;bythe
claim, V[G]∩V[H]=V. The placidity of the virtual condition p¯applied with
the models V[G] and V[H] now shows that p is compatible with all conditions
inthe model V[H] below p¯as desired.
Corollary 12.2.10. Let X be a Polish vector space over a countable field F.
1. LetP betheposetofcountablesubsetsofX whicharelinearlyindependent
over F, with the reverse inclusion ordering. In the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω and
OCA holds.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, X
has a linear basis over F, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω and
OCA holds.
Example 12.2.11. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X such that
for some n ∈ ω, Γ does not contain an injective homomorphic copy of K .

Then the coloring poset P of Definition 8.1.1 is Bernstein balanced and every

To this end, let V[G] be a generic extension and work in V[G]. Towards
contradiction,supposethatthereisaconditionp∈P suchthatc⊂p,aninfinite
poset Q ∈ V such that P(Q)∩V is countable in V[G], and an uncountable
family H consisting of filters on Q which are mutually generic over V such that
for each H ∈ H there is a condition p ∈ P ∩V[H] such that c ⊂ p and p

is incompatible with p. An examination of the incompatibility options and a
counting argument reveal that there must be a point x∈dom(p)\V such that
the family G ={H ∈H: ∃x ∈X∩V[H ]\V xΓx } is uncountable.
