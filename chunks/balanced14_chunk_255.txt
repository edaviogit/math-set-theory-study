268 CHAPTER 11. LOCALLY COUNTABLE STRUCTURES
The existence of finitely additive measures on complete Boolean algebras is a
usefultoolinforcingtheory,see[47]. TheSuslinversionofitneedstoreflectthe
fact that finitely additive measures on uncountable sets are typically not Suslin
in any sense. We use the following poor man’s version of a finitely additive
measure:
Definition 11.3.14. Let P be a very Suslin c.c.c. poset. We say that P is
Suslin measured if there are analytic sets A ⊂P and positive rationals ε >0
n n
(cid:83)
such that P = A and for every n∈ω and every finite sequence (cid:104)p : i∈j(cid:105)
n n i
of elements of A with possible repetitions there is a set b ⊂ j of size at least
n
ε j such that the set {p : i∈b} has a lower bound in P.
n i
NotethatthedefinitorypropertiesofthecoverP = (cid:83) A areΠ1 andtherefore
n n 2
persist to all forcing extensions. Note also that every Suslin measured poset is
Suslin Ramsey-centered as witnessed by the same analytic sets.
Theorem11.3.15. LetP beaverySuslinc.c.c.poset. IfP isSuslinmeasured,
then so are all of its finite support iterations of countable length.
Proof. As in the previous subsections, we proceed with claims dealing with the
successor and limit stage of the iteration.
Claim 11.3.16. Suppose that P,Q are very Suslin, c.c.c. posets which are
Suslin measured. Then P ∗Q˙ is Suslin measured.
Proof. Let A ,α for n∈ω and B ,β for n∈ω witness the Suslin measured
n n n n
property of P,Q respectively. Let C ⊂ P ∗Q˙ be the upward closure of the
nm
set of all pairs (cid:104)p,q(cid:105) such that p ∈ A and p (cid:13) q˙ ∈ B˙ . Let γ = α β .
n m nm n m
We claim that the sets C and the numbers γ witness the Suslin measured
nm nm
property of the iteration.
It is clear from Proposition 11.2.9 that the sets C are analytic; they
nm
also clearly exhaust all of P ∗Q˙. Now, fix numbers n,m ∈ ω. Suppose that
(cid:104)(cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105): i ∈ j(cid:105) is a sequence of conditions in the set C ; strengthening the
i i nm
conditions we may assume that p ∈A and p (cid:13)q˙ ∈B˙ holds for every i∈j.
i n i i m
By the properties of the set A , there is a set b⊂j such that |b|>α j and the
n n
conditions p for i ∈ b have a lower bound p. By the properties of the set B
i m
applied in the generic extension, it is possible to strengthen p and identify a set
c ⊂ b such that |c| > β |b| in such a way that p forces the set {q˙ : i ∈ c} to
m i
have a lower bound in Q˙. Then the conditions (cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105) for i∈c have a common
i i
lower bound in P ∗Q˙. As the set c ⊂ j has size > α β |j|, this verifies the
n m
desired properties of the set C .

Claim 11.3.17. Let (cid:104)P : n∈ω,π ,ξ : m≤n∈ω(cid:105) be a very Suslin system
n nm mn
consisting of Suslin measured forcings. Then the limit is Suslin measured.
Proof. Let P be the limit of the system as described in Definition 11.2.12. For
ω
each n ∈ ω, let A ,ε for m ∈ ω be analytic subsets of P and positive
nm nm n
rational numbers witnessing the measured property of P . For each n,m ∈ ω
n
let B ⊂P be the set {(cid:104)p,n(cid:105)∈P : p∈A }. It is immediate that the sets
