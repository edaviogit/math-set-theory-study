102 CHAPTER 3. TURBULENCE
Corollary 3.6.12. Let I be the usual summable ideal on ω. Let h: 2ω →X be
a Borel homomorphism of = to a virtually placid analytic equivalence relation
I
F on a Polish space X. Then there is an F-class whose h-preimage has full
µ-mass.
Proof. ByCorollary3.6.10,thereisanF-classwhoseh-preimagehaspositiveµ-
mass. However, the h-preimage is an = -invariant set, the equivalence relation
I
= includes E as a subset, and by the usual E -ergodicity considerations, the
I 0 0
h-preimage must in fact have full µ-mass.

of Corollary 3.6.10 and therefore witnesses the failure of the concentration of
measure in a strong sense.
Example 3.6.13. There is a summable-type ideal I on ω and a Borel homo-
morphismh: 2ω →2ω of= toE suchthatpreimagesofE -equivalenceclasses

are µ-null.
Proof. The key tool is the following:
Claim 3.6.14. For every i ∈ ω and every ε > 0 there is a number n ∈ ω and
sets a,b ⊂ 2n of the same relative size > 1−ε each, such that for every x ∈ a
2
and y ∈b the set {m∈n: x(m)(cid:54)=y(m)} contains at least i many elements.
Proof. Fix i and ε. Stirling’s approximation formula shows that there is n∈ω
such that the size of the set {a ⊂ n : ||a|− n| < i+1} is less than ε2n. Let
2
a={x∈2n :theset{m∈n: x(m)=1}containsatmost n−imanyelements}
2
and b = {x ∈ 2n : the set {m ∈ n: x(m) = 1} contains at least n +1 many
2
elements}. This works.

Towards the proof of the example, find a partition ω = I into finite sets
n n
such that for every n ∈ ω, the set 2In contains subsets a
n
,b
n
of the same size
such that their relative size in 2In is greater than 1/2−2−n, and if x∈a
n
and
y ∈ b are arbitrary elements, then the set {i ∈ I : x(n) (cid:54)= y(n)} has size at
n n
least n. Now, define w(m)= 1 if m∈I and I ={a⊂ω: Σ w(n)<∞}.

Define B ={x∈2ω: ∀∞n x(cid:22)n∈a ∪b }; this is a Borel set of full mass. For
n n
x ∈ B, define h (x) ∈ 2ω by h (x)(n) = 0 ↔ x (cid:22) I ∈ a . It is not difficult to

check that h : B →2ω is a continuous homomorphism from B to E such that

preimages of E -classes are of zero mass. The rest of the proof only adjusts h

to a Borel homomorphism h defined on the whole space.
To this end, let C for n ∈ ω be inclusion increasing compact subsets of B
