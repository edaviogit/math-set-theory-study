(cid:126)Γ of the graph Γ; each vertex has exactly one point in its outflow. For each
point x ∈ X let h(x) = (cid:104)x : i ∈ ω(cid:105) where x = x and x is the unique point

in the (cid:126)Γ-outflow of x . Then h is a (non-Borel) reduction of E to F and so in
i
the P-extension |E|≤|F|≤|E | holds.

Corollary 9.2.16. Let X be a Polish space and let Γ be a Borel, acyclic, locally
finite bipartite Borel graph on X in which every vertex has degree at least 2.

Example 9.2.17. Letn∈ω beanumber,letX beaPolishspaceandletΓbe
a locally countable Borel graph on X such that every finite subgraph of Γ has
chromatic number ≤ n. Consider the poset P adding a Γ-coloring by n colors
as described in Example 6.2.6. The balanced virtual conditions are classified
by total Γ-colorings by ≤ n-colors; these form a compact subset of nX. It is
not difficult to see that the inherited compact product topology satisfies the
demands of Definition 9.2.1.
Corollary 9.2.18. Let X be a Polish space and let Γ be a locally countable
Borel graph on X such that each finite subset of Γ has chromatic number ≤ n
for some fixed number n∈ω.

Example 9.2.20. LetΓ,∆beabelianPolishgroups,with∆divisibleandcom-
pact. LetP(Γ,∆)betheposetaddingahomomorphismfromΓto∆asisolated
in Definition 8.2.1. As proved in Theorem 8.2.2, the balanced conditions are
classified by homomorphisms from Γ to ∆. The space of homomorphisms is
a closed subset of ∆Γ equipped with the product topology. It is not difficult
to see that the demands of Definition 9.2.1 are met. Let us elaborate on the
extension property (2). If h: Γ→∆ is a homomorphism in some generic exten-
sion V[H ] then it can be extended to a homomorphism in any larger forcing

extension V[H ] by the divisibility of ∆ and Baer’s criterion [3]. Note that the

group ∆ remains abelian and divisible in all generic extensions by Mostowski
absoluteness.
