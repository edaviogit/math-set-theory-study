that Q(cid:13)fˇ⊂τ.
Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Then there must be a con-
dition q ∈ Q and points x ,x ∈ X such that q (cid:13) τ(xˇ ,xˇ ) (cid:54)= fˇ(xˇ ,xˇ ).

Let G ,G ⊂ Q be mutually generic filters containing the condition q and

let p = τ/G ,p = τ/G . By the initial choice of the function f, there

must be points y ,y ∈ X \V such that y ∈ p (x ,x ) and y ∈ p (x ,x ).

By the product forcing theorem, y ∈/ V[G ] and y ∈/ V[G ] holds. Thus,

(3) is obvious. For the last sentence, suppose that p ∈ P is a condition.
Consider the set mapping f: [X]2 → P(X) defined by f(x ,x ) = p(x ,x ) if
0 1 0 1
both x ,x ∈ X belong to d(p), and f(x ,x ) = X \{x ,x } otherwise. It is
0 1 0 1 0 1
not difficult to check that f is a set mapping without free triples. By item (1),
f represents a balanced virtual condition below p.
Definition 8.5.4. Let X be an uncountable Polish space. A thin set mapping
forcing isaposetP ofallfunctionspsuchthatforsomecountablesetd(p)⊂X,
p: [d(p)]3 →[d(p)]<ℵ0 is a set mapping without a free quadruple. The ordering
is defined by q ≤p if d(p)⊂d(q) and p⊂q.
Theorem 8.5.5. Let P be the thin set mapping forcing.
1. If f: [X]3 → [X]<ℵ0 is any set mapping without free quadruples, then
(cid:104)Coll(ω,X),fˇ(cid:105) is a balanced pair;
2. if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is any balanced pair, there is a set mapping f: [X]3 → [X]<ℵ0
withoutfreequadruplessuchthatthebalancedpairs(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105)and(cid:104)Coll(ω,X),fˇ(cid:105)
are equivalent;
3. distinct set mappings on X without free quadruples yield inequivalent bal-
anced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced if and only if 2ℵ0 ≤ℵ

.
Proof. For (1), it is clear that Coll(ω,X) (cid:13) fˇ ∈ p holds. For the balance,
suppose that V[G ],V[G ] are mutually generic extensions and p ∈ V[G ],

p ∈ V[G ] are conditions extending f. To construct the lower bound p of

d(p ). Let p be the function on [d(p )∪d(p )]3 defined by p ,p ⊂ p and if

x ,x ,x ∈ d(p )∪d(p ) are pairwise distinct points such that x ∈ d(p )\V

p (a) = p (a) = f(a). Second, we must verify that p has no free quadruple.
0 1
Let b ⊂ d(p) be a quadruple. If b ⊂ d(p ) or b ⊂ d(p ) holds, then b is not

free because p ,p contain no free qudruples. Otherwise, b can be listed as

{x ,x ,x ,x } such that x ∈ d(p )\V, x ∈ d(p )\V and x is enumerated
