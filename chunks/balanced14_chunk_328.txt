to have an upper bound in τ, which is then an element of τ which is not (cid:69)x

for any element x ∈ X ∩V[K]. In total, in V[K] there must be a poset R of
size <κ, an R-name σ for a condition in P such that σ ≤p¯and an unbounded
R-name η for an element of X such that R (cid:13) η is not (cid:69)-below any element of
V[K] and R(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13) η ∈τ.

14.3 Measure and category
Inthissection,weshowthatinbalancedextensionsoftheSolovaymodel,there
is a set of reals without the Baire property. We also provide a framework
for showing that in certain circumstances, all sets of reals may be Lebesgue
measurable. The following theorem is stated using Convention 1.7.16.
Theorem 14.3.1. In nontrivial cofinally balanced extensions of the symmetric
Solovay model, there is a set of reals without the Baire property.
Proof. Letκbeaninaccessiblecardinal. LetP beanontrivialSuslinposetsuch
that V |= P is balanced in every forcing extension. Let W be the symmetric
κ
Solovay model derived from κ and work in W. Let p ∈ P be a condition. We
must find a Polish space X, a condition p¯≤ p and a P-name τ for a subset of
X such that p¯(cid:13)τ does not have the Baire property.
The condition p ∈ P is definable from a real parameter z ∈ 2ω and some
parameters in the ground model. Let V[K] be an intermediate extension using
a poset of size < κ such that z ∈ V[K] and P is balanced in V[K], and work
in V[K] for a moment. Let p¯ ≤ p be a balanced virtual condition stronger
than P. Choose a poset Q of size <κ and a name σ for a condition in P such
that the pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) is balanced and in the balance equivalence class of p¯. Move
to the Q-extension. Since the poset P is balanced, it is not c.c.c. below σ by
Proposition 5.2.8(1), in particular it is not Suslin σ-linked below σ. Thus, the
analytic graph of incompatibility of conditions in P below σ has uncountable
Borel chromatic number. By the G -dichotomy, there is a continuous map

h: 2ω →P which is a homomorphism of G to the incompatibility graph on P
