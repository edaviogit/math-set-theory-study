state the usual two-step iteration and direct limit definitions in the definable
context. These definitions are verbose but contain no surprises.
Definition 11.2.10. Let P,Q be posets. A projection of Q to P is a pair of
order-preserving functions π: Q→P and ξ: P →Q such that
1. π◦ξ is the identity on P;
2. whenever π(q)≤p then q ≤ξ(p);
3. whenever p≤π(q) then there is q(cid:48) ≤q such that π(q(cid:48))≤p.
The following definition will be used at the successor stage of the iterations.
Definition 11.2.11. Let P be a very Suslin poset on a Polish space X and
Q be a very Suslin poset on a Polish space Y. Define P ∗Q˙ to be the set of
all ordered pairs (cid:104)p,q˙(cid:105) where p ∈ P and q is a nice P-name for an element
of Y such that p (cid:13) q˙ ∈ Q˙. The ordering is defined by (cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)p ,q˙ (cid:105) if

p ≤p and p (cid:13)q˙ ≤q˙ . The iteration P ∗Q˙ also includes the iteration maps

defined by ξ(p)=(cid:104)p,1 (cid:105).

The limit stages will be defined in the following way.

Finally, we are ready to approach the proof of Theorem 11.2.7.
Proof of Theorem 11.2.7. The argument proceeds by a standard transfinite in-
duction argument using the following claims:
Claim 11.2.13. Let P,Q be very Suslin c.c.c. posets. Then
1. P ∗Q˙ is a very Suslin c.c.c. poset;
2. the iteration maps are analytic and form a projection from P ∗Q˙ to P.
