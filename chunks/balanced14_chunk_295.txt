which there is a perfect collection H ⊂ P(Q) which consists of filters mutually
generic over V[K]. Work in the model V[K][G].
Use the result of Solecki [85] to fix a lower-semicontinuous submeasure µ on
ω such that I = {a ⊂ ω: lim µ(a\n) = 0}. Consider the poset R of triples

µ(a\s) < ε . The ordering is defined by (cid:104)s ,ε ,a (cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)s ,ε ,a (cid:105) if s ⊂ s ,

ε ≤ ε , and a ⊂ s ∪a . It is not difficult to see that R is a σ-linked poset,

and the union of the first coordinates of conditions in the generic filter is forced
to modulo finite contain every ground model element of I.

in the model V[K][G][a]. For every filter H ∈ H∩V[K][G], η/H ⊂ a modulo
finite holds, and the set H∩V[K][G] is uncountable as the poset R is c.c.c.
Thus, the set {H ∈ H: η/H ⊂ a modulo finite} is analytic, uncountable, and
therefore contains a nonempty perfect subset H(cid:48). Proposition 12.2.2 applied in

forced to be an uncountable subset of τ and each element of it is modulo finite
included in the set a.
Now we move to a rich list of examples of Bernstein balanced forcings and
related corollaries.

afilterH ∈H suchthatallconditionsinP∩V[H]belowp¯arecompatiblewith
P. By a Mostowski absoluteness argument, it is enough to find such a filter in
some further generic extension of V[G]. Let R be any poset adding a new real,
and let τ be an R-name for an element of H which is not in V[G].
Claim 12.2.9. R(cid:13)V[τ]∩V[G]=V.
Proof. Supposetowardsacontradictionthatthisisnotthecase. TheninV[G],
there must be a condition r ∈R, a set a∈/ V of ordinals, and a Q-name η such
that r (cid:13) aˇ = η/τ. Let K ,K ⊂ R be filters mutually generic over V[G], and

let H = τ/K , H = τ/K . Since in the model V[G], the perfect family H

consisted of filters on Q mutually generic over V, by a Mostowski absoluteness
argument this is also true in V[G][K ][K ]; in particular, H ,H ⊂Q are filters

mutually generic over V. By the product forcing theorem applied in V then,
V[H ] ∩ V[H ] = V. However, the set a ∈/ V belongs to both V[H ] and

V[H ] as a = η/H = η/H by the initial assumptions on the set a. This is a

contradiction.
