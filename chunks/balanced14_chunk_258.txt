aximal K-set. Sometimes, the domain of the
simplicial complex K is instead the collection of finite subsets of X consisting
of pairwise E-related points, and sometimes we actually seek a maximal K-set

with some additional largeness properties. The variations considered in this
section all fall under the following definition:
Definition 11.4.1. A locally countable pair is a pair (cid:104)K,L(cid:105) such that
1. K is a Borel locally countable simplicial complex on a Polish space X;
2. L⊂K is a cofinal Borel subset, i.e. ∀a∈K ∃b∈L a⊂b;
3. for every finite set a ⊂ X, a ∈ L just in case a∩c ∈ L holds for every
E -class c⊂X.
K
A K-set a ⊂ X is L-regular if every finite subset of a is a subset of a finite
subset of a which is in L.
The role of the set L deserves a comment. Note that item (3) holds with K
replacing L by the definition of the equivalence relation K; thus, distinct E -

toachieveinthiswaythough. Forexample, letGbeagraphonω andletK be
the simplicial complex of all finite G-colorings with colors coming from ω. Not
every maximal K-set needs to be a total G-coloring. To alleviate this unwanted
effect, let L ⊂ K be the set of those finite colorings whose domain is a natural
number; then every L-regular maximal K-set is in fact a total G-coloring.
Definition 11.4.2. Let (cid:104)K,L(cid:105) be a locally countable pair on a Polish space
X. The poset P is the poset of all sets p⊂K for which there is a countable
KL
E -invariant set dom(p) ⊂ X such that p is a L-regular, maximal K-subset of
K
dom(p). The ordering is that of reverse inclusion. If K = L, we refer to the
poset as P instead.

It is immediate that the poset P is Suslin and σ-closed; in fact, it is a special

from Theorem 6.6.6:
Theorem 11.4.3. Let (cid:104)K,L(cid:105) be a locally countable pair on a Polish space X,
with the associated poset P .
KL
1. For every L-regular maximal K-set A ⊂ X, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),Aˇ(cid:105) is
balanced;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) there is a set A as in (1) such that the
balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),Aˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct sets as in (1) yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
