The following two examples deal with quotient simplicial complex posets.

248 CHAPTER 10. UNIFORMIZATION
Example 10.5.6. Let E ⊂F be Borel equivalence relations on a Polish space
X such that every F-class consists of countably many E-classes. The E,F-
transversal poset P of Definition 6.6.5 is tethered.
Proof. We will show that P is λ-tethered where λ=(cid:105) . Let V[H ],V[H ] be
ω1 0 1
mutually generic extensions of the ground model V, and let p ∈ V[H ] and
0 0
p ∈ V[H ] be incompatible conditions in P. There must be elements x ∈ p

andx ∈p whichareF-relatedbutnotE-related. InviewofProposition2.1.7,

In V, let p(cid:48) ={q ∈P: q contains some realization of the virtual E-class d }

and p ≤p(cid:48) and p ≤p(cid:48) as required.

The following example covers all posets which associate a structure to each G-
class where G is a countable Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space, as in
Example 6.6.10.
Example 10.5.7. LetX beaPolishspaceandletE ⊂F beBorelequivalence
relations on X such that F is pinned and for each F-equivalence class C ⊂X,
E (cid:22) C is smooth. Then the E,F-transversal poset P of Definition 6.6.5 is
ℵ -tethered.

be elements x ∈ p and x ∈ p which are F-related but not E-related. Since
0 0 1 1
the equivalence relation F is pinned, there must be a point x ∈ X ∩V which
is F-related to both x ,x . By the initial assumptions on E,F, in the ground

model there also must be a Borel map h: [x] →2ω reducing E to the identity.

Since h(x )(cid:54)=h(x ), there must be distinct binary strings s ,s ∈2n for some

n∈ω such that s ⊂h(x ) and s ⊂h(x ). Let A ={q ∈P: p∩h−1[s ](cid:54)=0}
0 0 1 1 0 0
and A ={q ∈P: p∩h−1[s ](cid:54)=0}. It is clear that A ,A are analytic subsets
1 1 0 1
of P coded in the ground model, ΣA is incompatible with ΣA in P, and
0 1
p ≤ΣA and p ≤ΣA as required.

Example 10.5.8. Let F be a Fraiss´e class in a finite relational language with
strong amalgamation. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. Then the E,F-Fraiss´e poset P of Definition 8.6.3 is tethered. In addition,
if E is pinned, then P is ℵ -tethered.

Proof. Start with the general case. Let λ = (cid:105) . We will show that the poset
ω1
P is λ-tethered. For brevity, assume that F has just one relational symbol of
its language of some finite arity n ∈ ω. Thus, a condition p ∈ P is just a
single n-ary relation on a countable set dom(p) which respects the equivalence
E,andsuchthatitsE-quotientisaF-structure. LetV[H ],V[H ]bemutually
