They do not add any sets of
ordinals. A prominent example of a weakly balanced forcing which is not bal-
anced is one which adds a maximal almost disjoint family with a certain type
of approximations.

is naturally organized into a compact Hausdorff space–Definition 9.2.1. The
most prominent example is the poset P(ω) modulo finite–Example9.2.4. The
extensions of the symmetric Solovay model by compactly balanced forcings sat-
isfy |E |>|2ω|–Theorem 9.2.2. It is even true that the chromatic number of a
0
certain Hamming-type graph remains uncountable–Theorem 11.7.2.
Placid forcings are those in which placid virtual conditions exist: these
are virtual conditions p¯such that for any pair of separately generic extensions

The most prominent example is the poset adding a Hamel basis to the reals
with countable approximations–Example 9.3.5. The extensions of the symmet-
ric Solovay model by placid forcings do not contain any inequalities |E| ≤ |F|
whereE isanorbitequivalencerelationofaturbulentPolishgroupaction, and
F is an equivalence relation classifiable by countable structures–Theorem 9.3.3.

Tethered forcings are those for which, to establish the balance of a pair
(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105), it is enough to show that the pair decides virtual conditions of certain
complexity–Definition10.1.1. Mostbalancedforcingsaretethered; aprominent
example of an untethered poset is the collapse poset adding an injection of the

The perfectly balanced forcings are the balanced Suslin forcings for which,

given balanced condition p¯, there is a condition in P stronger than uncount-

The perfectly balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model satisfy such
