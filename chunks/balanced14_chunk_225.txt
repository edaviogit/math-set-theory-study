1. Let P be the E -linearization poset. Then in the P-extension of the

symmetric Solovay model, |Eω|(cid:54)≤|E | holds.

2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
E -quotient space is linearly ordered and yet |Eω|(cid:54)≤|E |.

Example 9.5.15. Let Γ,∆ be abelian Polish groups, with ∆ divisible. Let
P be the poset for adding a discontinuous homomorphism from ∆ to Γ as in
Definition 8.2.1. Then the poset P is compactly balanced and pod balanced.
Compact balance was proved in Example 9.2.20. For the pod balance, suppose
that V[H ],V[H ] are extensions mutually generic over a pod, and p ∈V[H ],

This section leaves perhaps more questions open than it resolves. We content
ourselves with quoting one glaring case:
Question 9.5.17. Does the conclusion of Theorem 9.5.4 stay in force if the
assumption of pod balance on P is dropped?

balanced extensions of the choiceless Solovay model, with a small proviso.
