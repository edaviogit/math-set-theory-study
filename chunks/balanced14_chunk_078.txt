and 2.8.3, there are Borel functions M: Y →Z, G: Y ×M →P(ω), P: Y →ω

the function defined by k(y)=τ(y)/G(y), which is Borel by Proposition 2.8.4.
It will be enough to show that k is a Borel reduction of E to E on the set of

Suppose first that y ,y ∈ Y are well-orders of the same length. Then

the models M(y ),M(y ) are wellfounded and isomorphic. Write N for their

The status of a Borel equivalence relation as pinned/unpinned may be absolute
between models of ZFC by Corollary 2.7.3. However, if one dares to look at
choiceless models, a much more colorful picture comes to sight. The simplest
description of the pinned status occurs in the Solovay model, where it actually
obeys a former conjecture of Kechris [48, Question 17.6.1].
Theorem 2.8.11. The following holds in the Solovay model derived from a
measurable cardinal. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. The following are equivalent:
1. E is unpinned;
2. F ≤E or E ≤ E.
