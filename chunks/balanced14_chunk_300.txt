p¯ is incompatible with only countably many conditions in the set
{σ /H ,σ /H : y ∈ 2ω} by the Bernstein balance of the virtual condition p¯.

Thus, p¯forces both τ ,τ to be Bernstein sets.

12.3. PLACID FORCING 315
Unliketheperfectlybalancedextensions,theBernsteinbalancedextensionsmay
exhibit chaotic structure of cardinalities below 2ω. This concern was addressed
in [97].
Example 12.2.20. Let P be the poset of all countable functions from 2ω to 2,
ordered by reverse extension. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal, let W be the
symmetricSolovaymodelderivedfrom κ, andletG⊂P beafiltergenericover
W. In W[G], let a = {y ∈ 2ω: ∃p ∈ G p(y) = 0} and a = {y ∈ 2ω: ∃p ∈
0 1
G p(y)=1}. In W[G], |a |=(cid:54) |a |.
0 1
Thus, 2ω can be decomposed into two uncountable sets of distinct cardinalities,
contradicting the full Silver dichotomy. In fact, one can prove all kinds of
pathologies regarding the cardinalities of a and a respectively; for example
0 1
|a2|(cid:54)≤|a | holds in W[G].
0 0
Proof. Work in W. Suppose towards a contradiction that p∈P is a condition
and τ is a P-name such that p(cid:13)τ: a˙ →a˙ is a bijection. The condition p as
0 1
well as the name τ have to be definable from some ground model parameters
and some parameter z ∈ 2ω. Find an intermediate model V[K] obtained as a
genericextensionofthegroundmodelbyaposetofsize<κsuchthatz ∈V[K].
Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ be the Coll(ω,c)-name for the set {q ∈
P: p ⊂ q ∧∀x ∈ V[K]∩2ω \dom(p) q(x) = 0}. This is a balanced virtual
conditioninP forthemodelV[K]. Foreverypointx∈2ω\dom(p)lety ∈2ω
x
be a point such that Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)p¯(cid:13) τ(xˇ)=yˇ , if it exists. As τ is forced
P x
to be an injection from a˙ to a˙ , for each x there can be at most one y of this
0 1 x
kind, and the function g: x (cid:55)→ y must be an injection from 2ω \dom(p) to
x
dom(p). Since the former set is uncountable and the latter is countable, there
must be a point x∈2ω\dom(p) which is not in the domain of g.
StillinthemodelV[K],thestatementthatx∈/ dom(g)meansthatColl(ω,<
κ) forces that either there is a condition below p¯in P which forces τ(xˇ) out of
V[K], or there are two distinct conditions in P stronger than p¯which force the
value τ(xˇ) to be two distinct points in V[K]. Suppose for definiteness that the
former is the case. Then there must be a poset R of size <κ, an R-name σ for
a condition in P stronger than p¯and an R-name η for an element of 2ω\V[K]
such that R(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13) τ(xˇ)=η.
P
In the model W, pick filters H ,H ⊂ R mutually generic over the model
0 1
V[K]. Let p =σ/H ∈P and p =σ/H ∈P; by the balance of the condition
0 0 1 1
p¯, p and p are conditions compatible in P, with some lower bound q ∈P. Let
0 1
y = η/H ∈ 2ω and y = η/H ∈ 2ω; by the product forcing theorem and the
0 0 1 1
choice of the name η, y (cid:54)=y holds. But then, q (cid:13)τ(xˇ)=yˇ and τ(xˇ)=yˇ , an
0 1 0 1
impossibility.

Placid forcings have been introduced in Definition 9.3.1; as we have seen in
