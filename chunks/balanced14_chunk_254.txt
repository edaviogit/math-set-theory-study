the Suslin Ramsey-centeredness is a property preserved under finite support
iterations of very Suslin forcings.

11.3. ITERATION THEOREMS 267
Theorem11.3.10. LetP beaverySuslinc.c.c.forcingwhichisSuslinRamsey-
centered. Let α ∈ ω be a countable ordinal. Then the finite support iteration

of P of length α is a Suslin Ramsey-centered forcing.
Proof. The argument proceeds by a straightforward transfinite induction argu-
ment given the following two claims.

p(cid:48) ∈A and p(cid:48) (cid:13)q˙(cid:48) ∈B˙ . It is not difficult to check that P ∗Q˙ = (cid:83) C ,

Claim 11.3.12. Let (cid:104)P : n∈ω,π ,ξ : m≤n∈ω(cid:105) be a very Suslin system

The theorem follows.
Theorem 11.3.13. The finite support product of countably many very Suslin,
Suslin σ-Ramsey-centered posets, if very Suslin, is Suslin σ-Ramsey-centered.
Proof. Let P for n ∈ ω be the very Suslin posets, with their Suslin Ramsey-
