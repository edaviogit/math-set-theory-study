. Suppose x is a set, f: x2 →ω+1 is a function such that
f(s,t)>0↔f(t,s)>0, and g: x2 →ω+1 is a function such that f(s,t)>0
implies g(s)=g(t). Then there is, up to an isomorphism unique, acyclic graph

H(x,f,g) together with an onto map h: y →x, where y is the set of vertices of
H(x,f,g), such that
• for every s,t ∈ x and every vertex v ∈ y, if h(v) = s then the set of all
neighbors of v mapped to t has size f(s,t);
• for every s ∈ x there are g(s) many connected components of the graph
H containing a vertex v with h(v)=s.
TheconstructionofthegraphH(x,f,g)isstraightforward. Notethatwhen-
ever u,v ∈ y are two vertices such that h(u) = h(v) then there is an automor-
phism of the graph H(x,f,g) sending u to v.

[96] provides further examples of grounded sentences beyond those obtained by
Theorems 2.4.5 and 2.4.8. The first item of the following theorem is related to
classical arguments going at least as far back as the unpublished work of Leo
Harrington in the 1980’s. Similar results also appear in [6] and [65].

Virtual spaces for equivalence relations which are not classifiable by countable
structures are often quite difficult to understand. To conclude this section, we
state another classification theorem and a couple of open questions.
