Example 7.3.8. Let k ∈ ω and let A be a sequence enumerating all ordered
finite graphs which contain no clique of size k. The fact that this is a Ramsey

7.4 Semigroup ultrafilters
In this section, we show that in a natural forcing connected with a countable
semigroup, the balanced conditions exist and are classified by idempotent ul-
trafilters. ThisconnectsthetheoryofbalancedforcingextensionswithRamsey

Definition 7.4.1. Let Γ be a countable semigroup. The poset P is defined
Γ
as follows. The conditions of P are elements of Γω. The ordering is defined
Γ
by q ≤ p if there are nonempty finite sets a ⊂ ω for all n ∈ ω such that
n
max(a ) < min(a ) and Π p(m) = q(n), where the products are always
n n+1 m∈an
taken in the increasing order.

and/or changing finitely many entries does not change the separative quotient
equivalence class of the condition. It follows that the separative quotient of P
Γ
is a σ-closed poset. The purpose of the poset P is clear from the following

Proposition 7.4.3. For every condition p ∈ P and every countable set A ⊂

P(Γ), there is a condition q ≤p which sorts out A.

In the end, let q ∈ P be defined by q(n) = p (n) and observe that the

conclusion of the proposition is satisfied.
Suppose that G ⊂ P is a generic filter. By Proposition 7.4.3 and a density

argument, the set U ⊂ P(Γ) of all sets b ⊂ Γ such that some condition p ∈ G
accepts b, is an ultrafilter. Also, G can be recovered from U as the set of all

conditions p ∈ P such that for all n ∈ ω, the set { p(m): a ⊂ ω is a
