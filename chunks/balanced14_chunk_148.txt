stances must be quite peculiar for the E,F-transversal poset to be balanced.
One class of examples of this type is captured by the following theorem. For
Borel equivalence relations E ⊂ F on a Polish space X write X∗∗, X∗∗ to be
E F
their respective virtual quotient spaces. A function f: X∗∗ → X∗∗ is a virtual
F E
E,F-selection function if for every virtual F-class c, the virtual E-class f(c)
is forced to be a subset of c. For each E,F-selection function f let τ be the
f
Coll(ω,(cid:105) )-name for the set of all countable subsets a⊂X such that for each
ω1
virtual F-class c, a contains a realization of the virtual E-class f(c).
Theorem 6.6.12. Let E ⊂F be Borel equivalence relations on a Polish space
X such that each F-class consists of countably many E-classes. Let P be the
E,F-transversal poset. Then

is balanced;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a virtual selection function f such
that the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105), (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;

3. distinct virtual selection functions yield nonequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Proof. The argument hinges on a simple claim of independent merit:
Claim 6.6.13. Let V[H] be a generic extension of V, and in V[H] let c be an
F-class which is a realization of a ground model virtual F-class. Then c is a
union of realizations of ground model virtual E-classes.
