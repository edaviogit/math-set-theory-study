The following poset introduced in [63] adds an infinite maximal disjoint family,

is Lebesgue measurable by Example 14.3.6.
Definition 8.9.6. The MAD forcing P consists of all pairs p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) such
p p
that a
p
⊂ [ω]ℵ0 is an infinite countable almost disjoint family, and b
p
is a
countable set of pairs (cid:104)s,a(cid:105) such that s is a partition of ω into finite sets and
a ⊂ a is a countable set. Moreover, for every pair (cid:104)s,a(cid:105) ∈ b and every finite
p p
(cid:83)
set d ⊂ a \a, there are infinitely many sets e ∈ s such that d∩e = 0. The
p
set P is ordered by coordinatewise reverse inclusion.
It is clear that the MAD forcing is Suslin and σ-closed. The union of the first
coordinates of conditions in the generic filter is forced to be a maximal almost
disjoint family by an elementary density argument.
Theorem 8.9.7. The MAD forcing is weakly balanced.
Proof. Suppose that p ∈ P is a condition, and write b = b ∪{(cid:104)s,a (cid:105): s is a
p p
ground model partition of ω into finite sets}. It is clear that for any poset
Q collapsing the size of the continuum to ℵ , Q (cid:13) (cid:104)aˇ ,ˇb(cid:105) is a condition in P

stronger than p. It will be enough to show that the pair (cid:104)Q,(cid:104)aˇ ,ˇb(cid:105)(cid:105) is weakly
p
balanced in P.
To this end, suppose that R ,R are partial orders and σ ,σ are respective
