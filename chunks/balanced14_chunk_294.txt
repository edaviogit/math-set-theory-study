Proposition12.2.2
applied in V[K] shows that in W, p¯ forces the set a = {y ∈ 2ω: p is in the
y
generic filter} to be uncountable. The set {η/H : y ∈ a} is then forced to be
y
an uncountable Γ-clique.

12.2. BERNSTEIN BALANCED FORCING 309
Theorem 12.2.6. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. In cofinally Bernstein balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model,
every subset of X is either covered by countably many E-classes or contains an
uncountable subset consisting of pairwise E-unrelated elements.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin forcing which is
Bernstein balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ, let p ∈ P be a condition and let τ be a P-name such that
p (cid:13) τ ⊂ X is a set which is not covered by countably many E-classes. We
will find a perfect set A⊂X consisting of pairwise E-unrelated elements and a
condition q ≤p, q (cid:13)τ ∩Aˇ is uncountable. This will prove the theorem.
The condition p and the name τ are definable from a parameter z ∈ 2ω
and some parameters in the ground model. Let V[K] be some intermediate
extension of the ground model by a poset of size < κ containing z and such
that P is Bernstein balanced in V[K]; work in V[K]. Let p¯≤p be a Bernstein
balanced condition in the poset P. Since the equivalence relation E is Borel,

is countable in W, there must be in V[K] a poset R of size < κ and R-names

sition 12.2.2 applied in V[K] shows that in W the condition p¯ forces that for
uncountably many y ∈ 2ω, p belongs to the generic filter. Then p¯(cid:13) τ ∩Aˇ is

uncountable as required.
Theorem 12.2.7. Let I be an analytic P-ideal on ω. In cofinally Bernstein
balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model, if A⊂I is an uncountable
set, then there is a set b∈I such that the set {a∈A: a⊂b} is uncountable.
Proof. Suppose that κ is an inaccessible cardinal and P is a Suslin poset which
is Bernstein balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model
derivedfromκandinthemodelW,letp∈P beaconditionandτ beaP-name
such that p (cid:13) τ ⊂ I is an uncountable set. We need to produce a condition
p¯ ≤ p and a set b ∈ I such that q (cid:13) {a ∈ τ: a ⊂ ˇb} is uncountable. The
condition p and the name τ must be definable from parameters in the ground
model and some real parameter z ∈ 2ω. Let V[K] be an intermediate forcing
extensionbyaposetofsize<κsuchthatz ∈V[K]andP isBernsteinbalanced
in V[K], and work in the model V[K].
By the assumptions on the poset P, there must be a Bernstein balanced
virtual condition p¯ ≤ p in the model V[K]. There must be a poset Q of size
< κ, a Q-name η for an element of I which is not in V[K], and a Q-name σ
for a condition in P stronger than p¯such that Q(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13) η ∈τ.
