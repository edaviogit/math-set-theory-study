8.5 Set mappings
In this section, we develop posets for adding interesting set mappings. Let
n∈ω. Aset mapping (ofarityn)onasetX isjustafunctionf: [X]n →P(X)
such that f(a)∩a = 0 holds for every set a ∈ [X]n. A free set for f is a set
b ⊂ X such that f(a)∩b = 0 holds for all a ∈ [b]n. Set mappings without
large free sets have been investigated by Komj´ath ??? and others. It is possible
to add such mappings on Polish spaces by balanced forcing. We start with an
interesting limiting result.
Proposition8.5.1. (ZF)LetX beanuncountablePolishspace. Ifthereisaset
mapping f: [X]2 →X<ℵ0 without a free triple, then there is a countable-to-one
function from X to ω .

Proof. For each x∈X let M be the model of sets hereditarily ordinally defin-
x
able from x and f. Let ≤ be the pre-ordering on the space X defined by y ≤x
if y ∈M .

that x ,x ∈ X are ≤-incomparable elements. Let x ∈ X be an ordinally

definable point which does not belong to the finite set f(x ,x ). Then x ∈/

f(x ,x ) since x is not definable from x , and x ∈/ f(x ,x ) since x is not

definable from x . Thus, the set {x ,x ,x } is a free triple for f, contradicting

the initial choice of f.
Second, we claim that if y < x are points in X then M |= M ∩ X is
x y
a countable set. Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Working in
the model M , let N be a countable elementary submodel of a large structure
x
containing x,y and f (cid:22) M . Since M contains uncountably many reals from
x y
the point of view of M , there is a point x ∈M \N. Let x ∈M ∩N be any
x 0 y 1 y
point which does not belong to f(x,x ). As in the first paragraph, {x,x ,x }

is a free triple for f, contradicting the initial choice of f.
Case 1. There is a point x such that M contains uncountably many elements
x
of X. By the previous two paragraphs, M contains all points of X. As ZFC

This proves the proposition in this case.

By the failure of Case 1, the range of h is a subset of ω . It is also a countable-

to-one map. Suppose towards a contradiction that for some ordinal α∈ω , the

set A = {y ∈ X: h(y) = α} is uncountable. Let y ∈ A be any point, and use
the case assumption to find y ∈ A such that x ∈/ M . By the linearity of ≺, it
y
follows that y < x. By the previous work, the reals of M are a countable set
y
in M , violating the assumption that the two models have the same ω . The
x 1
proposition follows in this case as well.
Proposition 8.5.1 shows that we cannot hope to produce a set mapping with
finite values with no free triple, as such a mapping yields an uncountable se-
