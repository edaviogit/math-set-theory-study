We come to the last case, where p¯is a maximal K-set in the ground model.
This is impossible though: p¯is then a balanced virtual condition in P by The-
orem 6.5.2, p ≤p¯and p ≤p¯, and so p ,p must be compatible by the balance
0 1 0 1
of p¯. This contradicts the initial choice of p ,p .

Example 10.5.4. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X of countable
coloring number. The Γ-coloring poset P of Definition 8.1.1 is ℵ -tethered.

Proof. We identify P with its Suslin dense subset isolated in Theorem 8.1.2.
