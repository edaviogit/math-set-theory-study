f Theorem 12.3.6, let Γ be a Polish group acting on
a Polish space X in a generically turbulent way, so that E is the resulting
orbit equivalence relation. Consider the space Γ×X ×X, its closed subset

model W. Let p ∈ P be a condition and τ be a P-name such that p (cid:13) τ is
a directed graph on the E-quotient space and for each pair (cid:104)c,d(cid:105) of distinct
E-equivalence classes, either (cid:104)c,d(cid:105) or (cid:104)d,c(cid:105) is in τ. We must find a condition
q ≤p and distinct E-classes c,d such that q (cid:13)(cid:104)c,d(cid:105)∈τ and (cid:104)d,c(cid:105)∈τ.
Both p,τ are definable in the model W from a parameter z ∈ 2ω and pa-
rameters in the ground model. Let V[K] be an intermediate forcing extension
obtained by a poset of size <κ containing z and such that P is placid in V[K];
work in the model V[K]. By the initial assumption on the poset P, there must
be a placid virtual condition p¯ ≤ p. Let Q be the Cohen forcing on X ×X,

symmetric Solovay model, Y does not have a transcendence basis.
