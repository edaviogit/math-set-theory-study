Claim 9.4.5. For n∈ω, the pair (cid:104)R ,η (cid:105) is an E-pin.
n n
Proof. If this failed for some number n ∈ ω, then in the model W there would
be filters H ,H ⊂ R mutually generic over the model M such that the
0 1 n n
points y = σ /H ,y = σ /H ∈ Y are E-unrelated. Let p = σ /H and
0 n 0 1 n 1 0 n 0
p = σ /H be conditions in the poset P; they are compatible by the balance
1 n 1
of p¯ . By the forcing theorem applied in the models M [H ] and M [H ], their

lower bound forces in P that τ([xˇ

and
[yˇ ] . This is impossible.

Proof. If this failed for some numbers n ∈ m ∈ ω, then in the model W there

balance of p¯ since p ≤ p¯ ≤ p¯ by demand (2) of Definition 9.4.1. By the

By Theorem 4.3.6, there is an E-pin (cid:104)R,η(cid:105)∈M which is equivalent to all
ω
the pins (cid:104)R ,η (cid:105) for n ∈ ω. Still in M , find a poset Q generating the model

M ,aQ-namex˙ forthesequencex ,andaQ-nameR˙ fortheposetR . Bythe
0 0 0 0
forcing theorem, there must be a condition q ∈Q which forces the following: x˙
has no E -equivalent in M , R˙ (cid:13)σ ≤p and Rˇ×R˙ (cid:13)η E η . Note that the
1 ω 0 0 ω 0 0
last statement means that the name η is E-pinned on the iteration Q(cid:22)q∗R˙ .

In the model W, let H ,H ⊂ Q (cid:22) q∗R˙ be filters mutually generic over the
0 1 0
model M , and write p = σ /H , p = σ /H , x¯ = x˙/H , x¯ = x˙/H ,
ω 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
y = η /H and y = η /H . The balance of the condition p implies that
0 0 0 1 0 1 ω
p ,p ∈P are compatible conditions. Since E is a pinned equivalence relation,
0 1 1
the points x¯ ,x¯ ∈ X are E -unrelated. Since the name η was pinned on the
0 1 1 0
iterationQ(cid:22)q∗R˙ ,thepointsy ,y areE-related. Intotal,inthemodelW,the

It turns out that one large class of nested balanced posets has already been
isolated in Definition 9.2.1:
