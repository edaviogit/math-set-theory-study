12 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
The Ramsey ultrafilter model. Consider the poset of infinite subsets of ω
orderedbyinclusionandtheassociatedextensionoftheSolovaymodelW. The
genericfilterisidentifiedwithaRamseyultrafilter,andwell-knownpre-existing
results [26, 56] show that in a suitable sense, every Ramsey ultrafilter is generic
over W for the poset P(ω) modulo finite. The resulting model was investigated
in numerous papers such as [63, 21].
Theorem 1.4.1. In the model W[U], the following statements hold:
1. ([21], Corollary 9.2.5) |E |(cid:54)≤|2ω|;
0
2. (Corollary 9.4.8) |E |(cid:54)≤|F| for any orbit equivalence relation F;

the E - and F -quotient spaces (Corollary 14.6.7 and Corollary 14.5.4) do

not carry even any tournament;
4. (Example 12.1.9) if E is a Borel equivalence relation and A is a subset of
the E-quotient space then either |A|≤ℵ or |2ω|≤|A|;

5. (Corollary 14.6.7) every nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω has nonempty inter-
section with the summable ideal;
6. (Example 10.5.9) countable-to-one uniformization.

It is challenging to discern between the resulting models by sentences which do
not mention ultrafilters.
There are many open questions about the Ramsey ultrafilter model. We
do not know how to classify the ultrafilters on ω in it. We do not know if
there can be Borel equivalence relations E,F such that |E| (cid:54)≤ |F| holds in W
and |E| ≤ |F| holds in W[U]. In particular, we do not know if this can occur
for countable Borel equivalence relations E,F or in the situation where E is
the orbit equivalence relation of a turbulent action of a Polish group and an
equivalence F classifiable by countable structures.
The Hamel basis model. Consider the poset P of countable sets of reals
which are linearly independent over the rationals. The generic filter yields a
Hamel basis B ⊂ R. It does not seem to be easy to provide a simple criterion
which would guarantee that a given Hamel basis is P-generic over the Solovay
model. Still, we understand the theory of the model W[B] fairly well:
Theorem 1.4.2. In the model W[B], the following statements hold:
1. (Proposition 9.2.22) E has a transversal;
0
2. (Corollary 9.4.30) E has a complete countable section;
