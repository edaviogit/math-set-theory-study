Proof. Fix a,k and let p∈P be an arbitrary condition. We must find a condi-
tion q ≤ p in the set D . First of all, the previous claim shows that one can

Example 2.5.33. Let X be a Polish space and let R ⊂ [X]<ℵ0 × X be a
combinatorially universal Borel relation with countable vertical sections. Let
n ≥ 1 be a number. Let G be the hypergraph of all sets a ∈ [X]n which are

R-free. Then

2. if Martin’s Axiom for ℵ holds then equality is attained.
n
Proof. Fix the number n ∈ ω. The argument depends on an old theorem of
Sierpin´ski [35]: ℵ is the smallest cardinal κ such that every relation T ⊂
n+1
[κ]n ×κ with countable vertical sections has a T-free n+1-tuple. To prove
(1), apply the Sierpin´ski theorem to show that there is no G -anticlique of size

find a relation T ⊂ κ<ℵ0 ×κ with countable vertical sections and no T-free n-
tuple. Thenusetheuniversalityassumptiontofindaninjectivehomomorphism

Definition 2.5.34. Let X be a Polish space. A Borel equivalence relation R
on [X]<ℵ0 with countably many classes is combinatorially universal if for every
cardinal κ and every equivalence relation T on [κ]<ℵ0 with countably many
classes, there is a c.c.c. poset P adding an injection π: κ → X which is a
homomorphism of ¬T to ¬R.
