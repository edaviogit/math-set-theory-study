For (2), let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair. Replacing Q with Q×Coll(ω,X) and
strengthening τ if necessary, we may assume that Q (cid:13) ∀x ∈ X ∩V x ∈ τ or
{x}∪τ is not a K-set. By a balance argument, for each x ∈ X it must be the
case that either Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ τ or Q (cid:13) {xˇ}∪τ is not a K-set. Let A ⊂ X be the
set of those points x∈X for which the former case prevails. Since Q(cid:13)τ ≤Aˇ,
in view of (1) and Proposition 5.2.4 it will be enough to show that A⊂X is a
maximal K-set.
Certainly, A ⊂ X is a K-set since it is forced to be a subset of a K-set τ.
Now suppose that A ⊂ X is not maximal and pick a point x ∈/ A such that
A∪{x} is still a K-set. Passing to a condition of Q if necessary, we may find
a finite set a⊂A and a Q-name σ for a finite subset of τ such that Q forces xˇ
to belong to the algebraic closure of aˇ∪σ and not to belong to the closure of
any of its proper subsets. Let η be a Q-name for an inclusion-maximal subset
of a∪{x}∪σ which is in K and contains a∪{x}. It is not equal to a∪{x}∪σ,
and it contains every element of σ\η in its algebraic closure by the exchange
property of the pre-geometry. Let H ,H ⊂ Q be filters mutually generic over

V and write p =τ/H , b =σ/H , and c =η/H , and similarly for p ,b ,c .

It will be enough to show that a∪b ∪b ∈/ K, since this will contradict the

initial assumption of balance of the name τ and the resulting compatibility of
conditions p ,p ∈P.

Note that x belongs to the algebraic closure of a∪b . By the idempotence

of the pre-geometry, it follows that every element of the nonempty set b \c

this shows that the latter set is not free and completes the proof of (2).
Finally, (3) is obvious. The last sentence of the theorem follows from a
straighforward application of Kuratowski–Zorn lemma–every K-set can be ex-
tended to a maximal K-set.
Example 6.5.4. [42] (An algebraic matroid) Let X be a Polish field over a
countable subfield F. Consider the Borel simplicial complex K of finite subsets
of X which are algebraically free over F. K is well-known to be generated by
the Borel pre-geometry of algebraic closure. Also, a finite set a ⊂ X is not in
K just in case it is a solution to a nontrivial polynomial with coefficients in F.
There are only countably many such polynomials and for each of them, the set
of solutions is F . Thus, the simplicial complex K is G and the poset P is
σ δ K
balanced by Theorem 6.5.2. The poset adds a transcendence basis to the field
X as the union of the generic filter.

Many simplicial complex forcings are naturally connected with a Borel equiva-
lence relation.
