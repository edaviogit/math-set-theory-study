202 CHAPTER 9. PRESERVING CARDINALITIES
Working in the model W, let H ,H ⊂ R be mutually generic filters, and
0 1
for bits b,c ∈ 2 let p = σ /H ∈ P and y = η /H ∈ 2ω. By the third
bc b c bc b c
item above, in the model V[K][H ,H ] there must be a bit c ∈ 2 such that
0 1
Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) u(φ ,y ,v ) (cid:54)= u(φ ,y ,v ). The conditions p ,p ∈ P are
0 00 0 1 1c 1 00 1c
compatible in W by the balance of the condition p¯, with a lower bound q ∈
P. Since W is the symmetric Solovay extension of the model V[K][H ], the

forcing theorem applied with that model yields that q (cid:13) τ(βˇ) = u(φ ,η ,v ).

Since W is the symmetric Solovay extension of V[K][H ], the forcing theorem

applied with V[K][H ] yields that q (cid:13)τ(βˇ)=u(φ ,y ,v ). Finally, since W is

holds in W. Thus, the condition q forces two distinct values to the name τ(βˇ),
an impossibility.
Corollary 9.1.2. In a cofinally balanced extension of a symmetric Solovay
model, there is no transfinite uncountable sequences of pairwise distinct Borel
sets of bounded rank.
Proof. Since cofinally balanced extensions add no countable sequences of ele-
ments of the Solovay model W by Theorem 9.1.1, all Borel sets in W[G] belong
to W and have the same Borel rank there as in W[G]. Thus, an uncountable
sequence of distinct Borel sets of bounded Borel rank in W[G] would have to
belong to W by Theorem 9.1.1 again. However, there are no such sequences in
the Solovay model W by a result of Stern [87].
Corollary 9.1.3. LetE beaBorelequivalencerelationonaPolishspaceX. In
cofinally balanced extensions of the symmetric Solovay model, ℵ (cid:54)≤|E| holds.

Proof. An ω -sequence of distinct E-classes would constitute an ω -sequence of
1 1
distinct Borel sets of Borel rank bounded by the rank of E. Such sequences are
ruled out by the previous corollary.
Corollary9.1.3guaranteesthatinbalancedextensionsofthesymmetricSolovay
model, the Friedman–Stanley jump divide is preserved. This follows from a
humble ZF result of independent interest.
Proposition 9.1.4. (ZF) Let X be a set and E an equivalence relation on X
with all classes countable. If |Xℵ0|≤|E| then |HC|≤|E|.
Proof. Let g be an injection from the set of all countable subsets of X to E-
classes. Define a function h from the collection of hereditarily countable sets to
E-classes by ∈-recursion: h(a) = g( (cid:83) h(cid:48)(cid:48)a). By induction on the minimum of
the rank a and b argue that a(cid:54)=b implies that h(a)(cid:54)=h(b). Thus the function
h is an injection and the statement of the proposition follows.
Corollary 9.1.5. LetE beaBorelequivalencerelationonaPolishspaceX. In
cofinally balanced extensions of a symmetric Solovay model, |E+|(cid:54)≤|E| holds.
