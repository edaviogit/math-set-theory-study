Theorem 12.3.6. Let E be an orbit equivalence on a Polish space resulting
from a generically turbulent action of some Polish group. In the cofinally placid
extensionsoftheSolovaymodel,thereisnotournamentontheE-quotientspace.
Proof. The argument depends on a simple abstract property of pairs of inde-
pendent continuous open maps on Polish spaces of Definition 3.1.3. Let m∈ω
be a number. For each natural number n ∈ m, let X be a Polish space, Y
n n
be Polish spaces and f : X → Y be continuous open maps. We define the
n n n
(cid:81) (cid:81) (cid:81)
product map f = f : X → Y by f(x)(n) = f (x(n)). It is not

difficult to check that the product map is continuous.
Claim 12.3.7. The set of pairs of independent maps is closed under finite
product.
Proof. Let m ∈ ω be a number. For each number n ∈ m let X be a Polish

space, Y ,Y be Polish spaces, and let f : X → Y , f : X → Y be

continuous open maps such that for all but finitely many n ∈ ω their ranges
are the whole spaces Y ,Y and such that each pair f ,f is independent.

To this end, let O ⊂ X be a nonempty open set; thinning out the set O if
(cid:81)
necessary, we may find open sets O ⊂ X for n ∈ m such that O = O .

Let A ⊂ Y be an open set witnessing the independence of the pair f ,f

f (x )∈B and for the last point x ∈w we have f (x )∈B .

Now, each walk w is a finite string of points; shifting the indexation, we

may find successive intervals I of natural numbers for n ∈ m such that each

walk w is indexed by numbers in I . Let K = I and consider the string

of points in the open set O indexed by k ∈K, defined in the following way: for

if n(k)<n. It is easy to see that the sequence (cid:104)x : k ∈K(cid:105) is the desired walk

in the set O from B to B .

Now, towards the proof of Theorem 12.3.6, let Γ be a Polish group acting on
a Polish space X in a generically turbulent way, so that E is the resulting
orbit equivalence relation. Consider the space Γ×X ×X, its closed subset
