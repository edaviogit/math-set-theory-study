There are several standard forcing notions used throughout:
Definition 1.7.11.
1. If X is a set then Coll(ω,X) is the poset of finite partial functions from
ω to X ordered by reverse extension;
2. if κ is a cardinal then Coll(ω,< κ) is the finite support product of the
posets Coll(ω,α) for all α∈κ;
3. if X is a topological space then P is the poset of all nonempty open
X
subsets of X ordered by inclusion. If X is in addition Polish, then x˙

denotes the P -name for the generic point of P –the unique element of

to all open sets in the generic filter.
The collapse poset obeys an important factoring rule:
Fact 1.7.12. [45, Corollary 26.11] Let λ be a cardinal and let P be a poset of
size <λ. Suppose that G⊂Coll(ω,λ) is a generic filter and in V[G], H ⊂P is
a filter generic over V. Then there is a filter K ⊂Coll(ω,λ) generic over V[H]
such that V[G]=V[H][K].
Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. The symmetric Solovay model derived
from κ is obtained as follows. Let G ⊂ Coll(ω,< κ) be a generic filter and in
V[G], form the model HODV[G] of all sets hereditarily definable from reals
V∪P(ω)
and elements of the ground model. This is the symmetric Solovay model; we
will always denote it by W, neglecting the dependence on κ and the filter G in
thenotation. ThetheoryoftheSolovaymodelhasbeenthoroughlyinvestigated
throughout the years. We note the following:
Fact 1.7.13. [87] In W, ZF+DC holds, every set has the Baire property and
is Lebesgue measurable, and there is no uncountable well-ordered sequence of
distinct Borel sets of bounded Borel rank.
DuringtheinvestigationofthesymmetricSolovaymodel,thefollowingtechnical
fact and its corollary about the symmetric Solovay model will be used without
mention.
