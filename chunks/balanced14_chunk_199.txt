Example 9.2.8. Let P be the Fin×Fin poset of Definition 7.2.1. The poset P
is compactly balanced.
Proof. The balanced virtual conditions of P were classified in Theorem 7.2.2.
Theycorrespondtoultrafiltersonω×ω∗ whichdonotcontainthesetn×ω∗ for
any number n ∈ ω. Thus, the space of balanced virtual conditions is naturally
organizedintoadefinablecompactHausdorffspace. Itisnecessarytoverifythe
conditions (2, 3) of Definition 9.2.1. Let V[H ]⊂V[H ] be generic extensions.

We first evaluate the complexity of the order between the balanced virtual
conditions in V[H

Let P(F,E) be the poset of Definition 8.6.3 for adding a F-structure to the E-
quotient space. Then P(F,E) is compactly balanced: the balanced conditions
