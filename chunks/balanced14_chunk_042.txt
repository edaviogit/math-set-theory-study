ple 2.4.6. However, if the equivalence relation E is Borel then the virtual
version is a set of size < (cid:105) by Theorem 2.5.6. In any case, it is possible to

stratify M∗∗ into set sized pieces:

at most 2κ. If κ ≤ λ are cardinals then Coll(ω,κ) is regularly embedded in
Coll(ω,λ) so M∗∗ ⊆M∗∗. Every poset is regularly embedded in Coll(ω,κ) for

some κ so M∗∗ decomposes into a monotone union (cid:83) M∗∗.

For each analytic quotient structure M, there is a canonical embedding
π: M∗ → M∗∗ which maps each class [x] to the virtual E-class of (cid:104)Q,xˇ(cid:105) for
E
a trivial poset Q. The most important fact about the virtual structures is that
there is some degree of elementarity:
Proposition2.2.5. Thecanonicalembeddingπ: M∗ →M∗∗ isΠ -elementary.

Proof. Let κ be a cardinal, and let G ⊂ Coll(ω,κ) be a generic filter. In the
modelV[G],letχ: (M∗∗)V →(M∗)V[G]bethemapsendingavirtualE-classin

The composition χ◦π sends each equivalence class in V to its interpretation in
V[G].
Let φ be a Π formula in L logic with possible parameters such that
1 ω1ω
M∗ |= φ. The statement M∗ |= φ is a Π1 sentence about the structure M,
2
and by Shoenfield absoluteness it transfers from the ground model V to the
generic extension V[G]. Thus, the map χ◦π is a Π elementary embedding
1
from (M∗)V to (M∗)V[G]. It follows that the map π: M∗ → M∗∗ in V must
κ
be a Π -elementary embedding. Since M∗∗ is an increasing union (cid:83) M∗∗, the
1 κ κ
proposition follows.
In particular, if the original quotient structure was a group, a partial order,
or an acyclic graph, its virtual version maintains these properties. However,
it is important to understand that the embedding does not have to be Σ -
2
elementary, so virtual versions of connected graphs may become disconnected,
virtual versions of divisible groups may not be divisible anymore, and virtual
versions of nonatomic partial orders may have atoms.
Example 2.2.6. Let R be the relation on X = (2ω)ω defined by x R x if

rng(x ) ⊆ rng(x ). Clearly, the tuple (cid:104)X,F ,R(cid:105) is an analytic quotient struc-

ture. The relation R∗ is a partial order on X∗ without largest element. At
the same time, the relation R∗∗ on X∗∗ does have the largest element, namely
the F -pin presented in Example ??: the pin corresponding to the name for a
2
generic enumeration of 2ω in ordertype ω. This follows immediately from the
classification of F -pins in Example 2.3.5 below.
