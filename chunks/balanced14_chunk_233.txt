Move to the model W. Let H ,H ⊂R ,R be filters mutually generic over

M , and let p = σ /H and p = σ /H . By the balance of the condition

p¯, p ,p ∈ P are compatible conditions with a lower bound q ∈ P. Let x =

χ/H ∈X. The contradiction is now reached by a split into cases.

Case 1. There exist a condition r ∈ H and a closed set C ∈ rng(η/H ) such

(cid:83)
that the ground model closed set D = X \ {O: O ⊂ X is a basic open set
such that r (cid:13)χ∈/ O} is a subset of C. By the closure of the collection I under
subsets,D ∈I holds;bythedefinitionofthesetD,x∈Dholds. Now,W isthe
symmetric Solovay extension of both models M [H ] and M [H ]. The forcing

theorem applied in M [H ] shows that W |= q (cid:13) D ⊂ C ⊂ τ. The forcing

theorem applied in M [H ] shows that W |= q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ D and xˇ belongs to no

ground model closed set in I which is a subset of τ . Thus, the same condition

q forces two contradictory statements.
Case 2. Case 1 fails. Then, by the mutual genericity of the filters H ,H it

(cid:83)
must be the case that x ∈/ rng(η/H ). Now, W is the symmetric Solovay

extension of both models M [H ] and M [H ]. The forcing theorem applied in

M [H ] shows that W |= q (cid:13) τ = (cid:83) rng(η/H ). The forcing theorem applied

10.5 Examples
In this section we present several examples of tethered and untethered partial
orders. In all affirmative examples below, the conclusion is that in view of
Theorems 10.2.2, 10.3.2, and 10.4.2, the extensions of the symmetric Solovay
model by the posets in question satisfy the pinned uniformization, the well-
orderable uniformization, and the Saint Raymond uniformization.

Example 10.5.1. Let K be a Borel simplicial complex on a Polish space X of
Borel coloring number ℵ . Then the poset P =P is ℵ -tethered.
