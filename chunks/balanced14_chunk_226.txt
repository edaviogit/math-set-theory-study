balanced extensions of the choiceless Solovay model, with a small proviso.

9.6. THE PINNED DIVIDE 237
Theorem 9.6.1. Let E,F be Borel equivalence relations on respective Polish
spaces X,Y, E pinned and F unpinned. In a balanced extension of a symmetric
Solovay model derived from an inaccessible limit of inaccessibles, |F| (cid:54)≤ |E|
holds.

posets which are balanced everywhere below κ as opposed to just cofinally bal-
anced. This is clear from Example 9.6.2 below.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal which is a limit of inaccessibles. Let P
be a Suslin poset which is balanced below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay
model derived from κ and work in the model W. Towards a contradiction, sup-
pose that p∈P is a condition and τ a P-name for an injection from F-classes
to E-classes. Both p,τ are definable from some parameter z ∈2ω and parame-
ters in the ground model. The assumptions imply that there is an inaccessible
cardinal λ < κ of V and a filter K ⊂ Coll(ω,< λ) generic over V such that
z ∈V[K].
Work in the model V[K]. The balanced assumption on the poset P implies
thatthereisabalancedvirtualconditionp¯≤pinP. Theorem2.7.1showsthat
E is pinned in V[K] and therefore has at most c = ℵ many virtual classes,

while Theorem 2.5.11 shows that F has at least 2ℵ1 many virtual classes. The
argument splits into two cases:
Case 1. For every poset R of size <κ, every R-name for a condition σ ≤p¯in
the poset P, every F-pinned R-name η for an element of X and every R-name
χ for an element of X such that R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ([η] ) = [χ] , the
P F E
name χ is E-pinned.
In this case, by a counting argument with the virtual E- and F-classes, it
must be the case that there are posets R ,R and respective names σ ,η ,χ

Case 2. Case 1 fails. Then, there has to be poset R of size <κ, every R-name
