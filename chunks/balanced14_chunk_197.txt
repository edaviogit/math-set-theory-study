4.7.1], where it was isolated for the first time. To define it, consider the σ-ideal
I on 2ω generated by Borel partial E -transversals, and let Q be the poset of
0
Borel I-positive sets ordered by inclusion. As every poset of this form, Q adds
a generic point in 2ω–the unique point which belongs to all Borel sets in the
generic filter [101, Proposition 2.1.2].
Fact 9.2.3. Let Q be the Vitali forcing and let G⊂Q be a generic filter. Then
1. [101, Theorem 4.7.3] every real in V[G] is the image of the generic point
x under a ground model Borel function (Q is proper);

2. [84, Proposition 4.5] for every set a ⊂ ω in V[G], either a or its comple-
ment contain a ground model infinite set (Q adds no independent reals);
3. [103, Theorem2.11] every real definable in V[G] from [x

Proof of Theorem 9.2.2. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Suppose that P is a

to 2ω. Both p,τ are definable from some real parameter z ∈ 2ω. Let V[K] be
an intermediate generic extension of V obtained by a forcing of size < κ such
that z ∈V[K] holds, and work in the model V[K].
Let Q be the poset of infinite subsets of ω, ordered by inclusion. Let Q
0 1
be the Vitali forcing of Borel subsets of 2ω on which E is not smooth, ordered
0
by inclusion. Let (cid:104)U,y(cid:105) be an object Q ×Q -generic over the model V[K];

that is, U is an ultrafilter on ω and y ∈ 2ω is a point. By the σ-closure of Q ,
0
the models V[K] and V[K][U] have the same reals, in particular they evaluate
the definition of the Vitali forcing in the same way and so y is a Vitali-generic
point over V[K][U] by the product forcing theorem. By Fact 9.2.3(2), and a
genericity argument, the ultrafilter U still generates an ultrafilter on ω in the
model V[K][U][y].
Now,workinthemodelV[K][U]. Letp¯ ≤pbeabalancedvirtualcondition

below p. Let also χ be any Q -name for a balanced virtual condition in P in

themodelV[K][U][y]belowp¯ . Thisispossibleby(2)ofDefinition9.2.1. Note
0
that the model V[K][U][y] has more reals than V[K][U]; thus, the balance of
the condition p¯ does not necessarily transfer from V[K][U] to V[K][U][y] and
0
p¯ may have to be improved in a nontrivial way to get a balanced condition
0
in V[K][U][y]. For each n ∈ ω, let y ∈ 2ω be the binary sequence obtained
n
from y by replacing its first n entries by 0. Note that for each n ∈ ω, y is
n
still Q -generic over V[K][U], and V[K][U][y] = V[K][U][y ]. In the model
1 n
V[K][U][y], let p¯ be the U-limit of the sequence χ/y for n ∈ ω. By (3) of
1 n
Definition 9.2.1, it is the case that p¯ ≤p¯ ≤p. Note also that the definition of

p¯ does not depend on y per se, but only on the E -class of y. The treatment
