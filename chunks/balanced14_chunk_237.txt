By Proposition 2.1.7, there is an n-tuple d(cid:126)of virtual E-classes in V such that
for each i ∈ n, (cid:126)x (i),(cid:126)x (i) are realizations of d(cid:126)(i). Let p(cid:48) = {q ∈ P: dom(q)

are virtual conditions on the posets which carry the virtual E-classes on the
tuple d(cid:126), and these are of size < λ by Theorem 2.5.6. In addition, p(cid:48),p(cid:48) are

incompatible, and p ≤p(cid:48) and p ≤p(cid:48) as required.

The ultrafilter posets typically do satisfy the tether demands.

is ℵ -tethered.

Proof. We use the terminology of Section 7.3. In particular, the sequence A is
written as (cid:104)A : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of structures on pairwise disjoint sets. Let n ∈ ω be a

natural number. Write D for the set of all copies of A which are a subset of

models and strengthening the conditions if necessary, by Claim 7.3.5 we may
assume that for each n ∈ ω and each set b ⊂ D in the ground model, either

pAn ⊂ b or pAn ∩b = 0 modulo finite, and similarly for subscript 1. Let (F )

be the set of all ground model elements of P(D ) for which the first option

prevails, and similarly for subscript 1.
Suppose first that there is a number n ∈ ω for which (F ) (cid:54)= (F ) . For

definiteness, suppose that there is some set b ∈ (F ) \(F ) . Then let p(cid:48) =

The sets p(cid:48),p(cid:48) ⊂ P are analytic and coded in the ground model. Also, clearly

Σp(cid:48),Σp(cid:48) are incompatible in P, and p ≤Σp(cid:48) and p ≤Σp(cid:48) as desired.
