Theorem 1.2.4. (Theorem2.8.9) Suppose that there is a measurable cardinal.
Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space X. Exactly one of
the following occurs:

1. κ(E),λ(E)<∞;
2. E is almost Borel reducible to E.

Theorem 1.2.5. (Corollary 2.8.13) In the symmetric Solovay model: let E be
a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X. Exactly one of the following
occurs:
1. E is pinned;
2. F is Borel reducible to E.

In Chapter 3, we deal with a more sophisticated geometric concern. Let E
be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space X. Is it possible to find
two generic extensions V[H ] and V[H ] of V such that V[H ]∩V[H ] = V

but not in V? Note that we do not ask the extensions to be mutually generic.
In an initial approach, we develop a fruitful method for constructing separately
Cohen-generic extensions V[H ] and V[H ] such that V[H ]∩V[H ] = V. We

Theorem 1.2.7. (Theorem 3.2.2) Let Γ be a Polish group acting on a Polish
