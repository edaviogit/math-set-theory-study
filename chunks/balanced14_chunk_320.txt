13.3 Examples
The first batch of examples deals with the implications and limitations of The-
orem 13.2.7. We use Theorem 13.2.1 to add the nonexistence of discontinuous
homomorphisms of Polish groups to the conclusions for reference purposes.
Example 13.3.1. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
LetP betheposetforaddingatournamentontheE-quotientspaceasinExam-
ple 8.6.6. Then P is 3,2-centered by its definition, balanced by Theorem 8.6.4,
and tethered by Example 10.5.8. It is compactly balanced, so does not add a
E -transversal by Example 9.2.11. Thus, Theorem 13.2.7 applies to it, as do all

other theorems of Section 13.2.
Corollary 13.3.2. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
1. Let P be the tournament poset associated with E as in Example 8.6.6. In
the P-extension of a symmetric Solovay model, there are no discontinuous
homomorphisms of Polish groups, an there is no linear ordering on the
E -quotient space.

is a tournament on the E-quotient space while there are no discontinuous
homomorphisms of Polish groups and there is no linear ordering on the
E -quotient space.

Example 13.3.3. Let E be a countable Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. Let P be the poset adding an action of Z on X inducing E as in
Example 6.6.10. The poset P is 3,2-centered by its definition, balanced by Ex-

by Corollary 11.4.12. Thus, Theorem 13.2.7 applies to it, as do all other theo-
rems of Section 13.2.
Corollary 13.3.4. Let E be a countable Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X.
1. Let P be the poset adding an action of Z on X inducing E as in Exam-
ple 6.6.10. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model, there are
no discontinuous homomorphisms of Polish groups, and there is no linear
ordering on the E -quotient space.

2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, E
is an orbit equivalence relation of a (discontinuous) Z-action, there are
no discontinuous homomorphisms of Polish groups, and there is no linear
ordering on the E -quotient space.

Example 13.3.5. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X Suppose that
Γ does not contain an injective homomorphic copy of K→ and K for some
ω,ω n,ω1
number n ∈ ω. Let P be the coloring poset of Definition 8.1.1. The poset P
is 3,2-centered by its definition, it is balanced by Theorem 8.1.2 and tethered
