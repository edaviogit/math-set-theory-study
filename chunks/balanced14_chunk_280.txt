proved.

The condition p ∈ P as well as the name τ are definable in the model W
from parameters in the ground model and a parameter z ∈2ω. Let V[K] be an
intermediate forcing extension obtained by a poset of size < κ, containing the
point z. Work in V[K] and consider the poset Q×R where Q is the poset of
infinite subsets of ω ordered by inclusion. Let U ⊂ Q and y ∈ Y be mutually

ω in the model V[K][U]. The poset Q is σ-closed, and therefore R computed in
the model V[K][U] is the same as R computed in the model V[K] and y is in
factR-genericoverthemodelV[K][U]. Bythecontinuousreadingofnamesfor
the poset R, the sets P(ω)∩V[K][U][y] and P(ω)∩V[K][y] are the same. By
a mutual genericity argument and the fact that R adds no independent reals,
U generates an ultrafilter on ω in the model V[K][U][y]. Work in the model
V[K][U].
Claim 11.7.5. There is an R-name σ for a balanced condition in P such that
C (cid:13)∀y ∈Y y =y˙ up to finitely many entries→σ/y˙ =σ/γ·y˙ .

forcing extension. The claim therefore says that the evaluation of the name
σ does not depend on the specific generic point, but only on its modulo finite
equivalence class.
Proof. Choose an arbitrary R-name χ for a balanced condition below the con-
dition p. We now use the ultrafilter U and the compact balance of the poset
P to integrate the name χ. Choose any point y ∈ Y. For each n ∈ ω, let y˙
ω n
be the R-name below C for the element of Y such that y˙ (cid:22) n = y (cid:22) n and
n ω
y˙ (cid:22) [n,ω) = y˙ (cid:22) [n,ω); note that y˙ is forced to be a point R-generic over
