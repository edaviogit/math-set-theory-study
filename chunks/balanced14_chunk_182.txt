sociated with X consists of pairs p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) where a ⊂ X is a

finite set, b ⊂ X is a countable set, and a ∩b = 0. The ordering is that of

coordinatewise reverse inclusion.

The finite-countable poset is rather worthless in the ZFC context. The lack
of control over the finite part means that it collapses ℵ . Namely, for every

hand, it does satisfy ℵ -c.c. in ZFC, and so by a straightforward absoluteness

argument cannot contain a perfect antichain. This should be contrasted with
the convoluted answer to Woodin’s question given in [46].
In the ZF+DC context, the finite-countable poset is much better behaved,
as is clear from the following theorem. The generic filter will add a partition of
the space X into two sets, one of which does not contain an infinite countable
subsetandtheothercontainsnoperfectsubset. Suchapartitionclearlyviolates

In order to classify the balanced conditions in the finite-countable poset, we

name for a condition in the poset P which is the pair (cid:104)a,(X∩V)\a(cid:105).
Theorem 8.7.2. Let X be a Polish space and P the associated finite-countable
poset.
1. For every finite set a⊂X, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) is balanced in P;
a
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a finite set a ⊂ X such that the
balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
a
3. distinct finite sets yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
Proof. For (1), suppose that V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic extensions of
0 1
the ground model V and p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) ∈ V[H ] and p = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) ∈ V[H ] are
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
conditions stronger than p¯= (cid:104)a,(X ∩V)\a. We have to show that p ,p are
0 1
compatible, which is to say that a ∩b = a ∩b = 0 holds. Suppose towards
0 1 1 0
a contradiction that for example x∈a ∩b is a point. By the product forcing
0 1
theorem, x∈V[H ]∩V[H ]=V. If x∈a then x∈b is impossible as p ≤p¯,
0 1 1 1
and if x∈/ a then x∈a is impossible as p ≤p¯. A contradiction!

For (2), let τ = (cid:104)a˙,b˙(cid:105) where a˙,b˙ are Q-names for disjoint subsets of X.
A balance argument show that for each point x ∈ X, either Q (cid:13) xˇ ∈ a˙ or
Q(cid:13)xˇ∈b˙. Leta⊂X bethesetofallpointsx∈X forwhichthefirstalternative
prevails. It is immediate that a is a finite set and Q×Coll(ω,X) (cid:13) τ ≤ τ .

8.8 Side condition forcings
Attempts to force uncountable subsets of Polish spaces with a lack of internal
structure often converge to a kind of a side condition poset. Posets of this kind
