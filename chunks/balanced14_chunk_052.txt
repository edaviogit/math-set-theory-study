2.5. CARDINAL INVARIANTS 51
Theorem 2.5.4. Let E,F be analytic equivalence relations on Polish spaces
X,Y respectively. If E ≤ F then κ(E) ≤ κ(F) and λ(E,P) ≤ λ(F,P) holds
a
for every partial order P.
Proof. Suppose that h: X →Y is a Borel function witnessing the reduction of
E to F everywhere except for a set Z ⊂ X consisting of countably many E-
classes. ByaShoenfieldabsolutenessargument,thesepropertiesofthefunction
h transfer to all generic extensions. If P is a partial ordering and τ is an E-
pinned name on P which is not a name for one of the classes in the set Z, then
h˙(τ) is an F-pinned name on P, and the map τ (cid:55)→h˙(τ) respects virtual E- and
F-classes, and it is an injection from the former to the latter. It follows that
λ(E,P)≤λ(F,P).
Now,supposethatQisanotherposetandthath(τ)hasaF¯-equivalentname
σ onQ. BytheShoenfieldabsoluteness,Q(cid:13)∃x∈X\Z h˙(x)=τ; anyQ-name
for such an x is E-pinned and the name for h(x) is F¯-equivalent to h(τ). A
brief bout of diagram chasing now shows that κ(E) ≤ κ(F) and the theorem
follows.
The following neat application has been observed by [96] for the case of Borel
equivalence relations classified by countable structures.

cardinalasopposedto∞. Theorem2.3.4showsthatvirtualE+-classesareclas-

then completes the argument.
2.5b Estimates
The key fact about the pinned cardinal is the following theorem. It shows that
there are a priori bounds on the size of the pinned cardinal; in particular, if the
equivalence relation E is Borel, then κ(E) ≤ (cid:105) and the virtual space of E is
a set. Recall that the (cid:105) function is defined by r ω e 1 cursion: (cid:105)
