294 CHAPTER 11. LOCALLY COUNTABLE STRUCTURES
Still working in the model V[K][U], find a name σ as in the claim. By a
standard balance argument, R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ decides in P the value of
τ(y˙ ). Passing to a condition r if necessary, we may assume that there is a
gen
specific number m ∈ ω such that r (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ(y˙ ) = mˇ. Now,
P gen
let y ∈ Y be a point R-generic over the model V[K][U], meeting the condition
r andletp¯=σ/y. Findanumbern∈ω suchthatthesetr(n)containsanH -
n
hyperedge b∈H and for each i∈b let y ∈Y be the point obtained from y by
n i
replacing the n-th entry of y with i. Thus, the set {y : i∈b} is a G-hyperedge
i
(this is exactly the point which does not work if a skew product variation of G
is considered) and for each i∈n we have p¯=σ/y by the choice of the name σ.

By the forcing theorem, in the model W p¯(cid:13) ∀y ∈ a τ(y) = mˇ, completing

the proof.
Corollary11.7.6. LetG,H beanalyticlocallycountablehypergraphsonrespec-
tive Polish spaces X,Y such that G has Borel σ-bounded chromatic number and
H is actionable and does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number. Then
it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, G has
countable chromatic number and yet H has uncountable chromatic number.

Proof. Let X = B be a partition into Borel sets witnessing the Borel σ-
n n
bounded chromatic number of G. Let E be a countable Borel equivalence rela-
tion on X such that all hyperedges of G consist of pairwise E-related elements.
For each n∈ω let P be the poset of functions p whose domain is a countable

relatively E-invariant subset of B , range is a subset of n, and p is a partial G-

chromatic number of H is uncountable by Theorem 11.7.2. At the same time,
the poset P adds a total G-coloring on the set B with n many colors and

therefore the product P forces G to have countable chromatic number.
Corollary 11.7.7. Let Z act freely and in a measure preserving Borel way on
a Polish probability space (cid:104)X,µ(cid:105). Let G be the hypergraph of arity three on X
containing a triple {x ,x ,x } if there is a number n∈ω such that n·x =x

chromatic number of G is uncountable and the chromatic number of G is

2. it is also consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
the chromatic number of G is two and the chromatic number of G is
