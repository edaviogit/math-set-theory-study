room for improvement in the statement of the theorem.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset which is σ-
closed, and balanced and ℵ -tethered below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay

model derived from κ and work in W. Suppose towards a contradiction that
p ∈ P is a condition and τ is a P-name such that p (cid:13) τ is a tournament on
the F -quotient space. Both p,τ must be definable from some real parameter

z ∈2ω and some parameters in the ground model. Let V[K] is an intermediate
extension by a poset of size <κ such that z ∈V[K].
Work in the model V[K] for a moment. Let p¯ ≤ p be a balanced virtual
condition in the poset P in V[K]. Let λ < κ be a cardinal such that p¯ is
represented on a poset of size < λ, let Q be the finite support product of
0
copies of Coll(ω,λ) indexed by λ+ with finite product of copies of the Cohen
forcing indexed by 2×λ+. for any ordinal α∈λ+ write Qα for the part of the
0
product indexed by ordinals below α. Let η and η be the Q -names for the

Claim 14.5.2. Q forces χ to be a balanced condition in P below p¯.
Proof. Let G ⊂ Q and H ⊂ Q be generic filters over V[K] and work in
0 1
V[K][G][H]. First, use the σ-closure assumption on P to conclude that in fact
χ/G∗H is forced to be a nonzero virtual condition. In some further collapse
extension, the filter H contains a cofinal countable sequence, which then has a
lower bound and that lower bound will be a condition below χ/G∗H.
Second, use the tether assumption to conclude that χ/G∗H is a balanced
condition. Observe that by a genericity argument with the filter H, for every
analytic subset A⊂P coded in the V[K][G ], H contains a condition which is
0
either below some element of A or incompatible with all elements of A. Since
theposetP (andsoQ )isσ-closedinV[K][G],itdoesnotaddanynewanalytic

subsets of P. As a result, it is forced that χ/G∗H is either stronger than or
incompatible with any given virtual condition in P in the model V[K][G][H]
carried by a poset of size < ℵ (i.e. an analytic subset of P). The balance of
0
χ/G∗H immediately follows from the definition of ℵ -tether.
