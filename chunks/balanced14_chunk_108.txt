4.3 Choice-coherent sequences of models
Inmostofourexamples,wewillwanttolookatsequencesofmodelswhichhave
a greater degree of coherence. Certain constructions arising from the axiom of
choice will have to be performed in a coherent way. The following definition
records the demands:
Definition 4.3.1. Let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be an inclusion decreasing sequence of
n
transitive models of ZFC. We say that the sequence is choice-coherent if it is
coherent and for every ordinal λ there is a well-ordering ≤ of V ∩M such
λ λ 0
that its intersection with each model M belongs to M .
n n
In the common case of generic coherent sequences, the choice-coherence can be
detected from the theory of the intersection model as follows:
Theorem 4.3.2. Suppsoe that (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a generic coherent sequence of
n
generic extensions of V. The following are equivalent:
1. (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) is choice-coherent;
n
(cid:84)
2. M = M is a model of ZFC.
ω n n
Proof. For the (1)→(2) direction, assume the choice coherence. Let λ be any
ordinal. In view of Theorem 4.2.9, we only need to produce a well-ordering
≤∗ of V ∩M such that ≤∈ M . Fix a wellordering ≤ witnessing the fact
λ ω ω
that (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is a choice-coherent decreasing sequence, and note that
n
≤∗=≤ ∩M works as desired. The genericity assumption is not needed for
ω
this direction.

n n n n
that τ /G ⊂P is a filter generic over V such that M =V[τ /G ], and
n n n+1 n+1 n n
G =τ /G . It is not difficult to see that the tail (cid:104)P ,G ,τ : n≥m(cid:105) of the
n+1 n n n n n
sequence can be recovered from G , and therefore the sequence is coherent.
