Example 9.5.11. Let K be a locally countable Borel simplicial complex on
a Polish space X. Then the poset P = P is pod balanced. To see this,

Many posets associated with locally countable simplicial complexes are com-
pactly balanced; we get for example the following.
Corollary 9.5.12. Let Γ be a Borel locally finite graph on a Polish space X
satisfying the Hall’s marriage condition.
1. Let P be the poset adding a perfect matching to Γ with countable ap-
proximations. Then in the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model,
|Eω|(cid:54)≤|E | holds.

Example 9.5.13. Let P be the poset adding a linear ordering on the E -

quotient space as in Example 8.6.5. Then the poset P is compactly balanced
and pod balanced. Compact balance was proved in Example 9.2.11. For the
pod balance, suppose that V[H ],V[H ] are extensions mutually generic over
