just in case x,y ∈ X are orbit-equivalent. Let a ∈ K be a nonempty finite
partial G-coloring in a single E-class. We will compute a support supp(a) such
that if a,b∈K are subsets of the same E-class and supp(a)∩supp(b)=0 then
a∪b∈K. This will be enough by Theorem 11.4.14.
Let n(a)∈ω be the smallest number larger than all elements of rng(a) and
all numbers n such that there are points x ,x ∈ dom(a) with n·x = x .

Theorem 11.4.14. Suppose that a,b∈K are colorings in the same E-class with
disjoint supports; we must show that a∪b ∈ K. It is not hard to check that
a∪b is in fact a function. To see that it is a G-coloring, let {x ,x ,x } ∈ G
0 1 2
be a hyperedge which is a subset of dom(a)∪dom(b); we must show that the
coloringa∪bisnotconstantonit. Ifitisasubsetofdom(a)ordom(b),thenwe
are done as both a,b are G-colorings. Otherwise, two of the points (say x ,x )

point (z) has to be in the domain of the other coloring (b). If b(z)(cid:54)=a(x ) then

we are done. However, b(z) = a(x ) is impossible: then b(z) ∈ n(a) and so

(cid:104)z,b(z)(cid:105)∈supp(a)∩supp(b), violating the initial assumptions on a,b.
In order to force a total G-coloring, we need to choose a cofinal subset L ⊂ K
such that L-regular maximal K-sets are in fact total colorings. One possible
choice is L = {a ∈ K: for every infinite E-class c ⊂ X, dom(a) ∩ c is a
subinterval of the shift order on c, and the values of a at the endpoints of
this interval are larger than the length of the interval}. The verification of the
requisite property of L is easy and left to the reader.
Corollary 11.4.20. Let G bethehypergraphand (cid:104)K,L(cid:105) bethe locallycountable
pair of Example 11.4.19. Let H be an analytic graph of uncountable chromatic
number.
1. In the P -extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of H is
KL
uncountable;
2. it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds and
the chromatic number of G is countable while the chromatic number of H
is uncountable.
11.5 Larger graphs
In this section, we study the options for adding Γ-colorings with countably
many colors to various, not necessarily locally countable Borel graphs Γ on
Polishspaceswhilepreservingthemainfeaturesoflocallycountablestructures.
The main tool is the control forcing of finite approximations to such colorings,
as recorded in the following definition.
