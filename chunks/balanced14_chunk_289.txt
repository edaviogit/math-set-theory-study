Once the induction is performed, let p=(cid:104)γ : n∈ω(cid:105), let B ⊂2ω be the perfect

set of all points y ∈ 2ω such that ∀n ∃t ∈ 2n u ⊂ y and observe that p is the
t
lower bound of the set f(cid:48)(cid:48)B.
To start the induction, let u =0 and a =0. Now suppose that the nodes

Corollary 12.1.12. Let P be the poset of Subsection 7.4 designed to add a
stable ordered union ultrafilter.
1. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model, the full Silver di-
chotomy holds, and OCA+ holds.
2. ItisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is a stable ordered union ultrafilter on ω, the full Silver dichotomy holds,
and OCA+ holds.
Example 12.1.13. The Fin×Fin poset P of subsets of ω×ω with infinitely
many infinite vertical sections, ordered by inclusion, is perfectly balanced but
not perfect.
Proof. Wefirstprovethefailureofperfectness. Foreachn∈ω andeachbinary
string t∈2n, it is easy to find a perfect set A ⊂P(ω) such that
t
• A consists of pairwise almost disjoint infinite sets;
t
• whenever {x : t∈2n} is a collection such that x ∈A , the set (cid:84) x ⊂ω

is infinite.
Then, let f : [t] → P(ω) be a continuous injection into A for every t ∈ 2<ω.

Now, for every y ∈ 2ω let g(y) ⊂ ω×ω be the set of all pairs (cid:104)n,m(cid:105) such that
m∈f y(cid:22)n (y). Itisclearthatthesetg(y)⊂ω×ω hasallverticalsectionsinfinite
and so is a condition in P. We will show that any finite subset of g(cid:48)(cid:48)2ω has a
lower bound in P, yet no condition in P is below more than countably many
elements of g(cid:48)(cid:48)2ω.
For the first assertion, let a ⊂ 2ω be a finite set. Let m ∈ ω be such that
the strings y (cid:22) m for y ∈ a are pairwise distinct. Then, for all n ≥ m the
