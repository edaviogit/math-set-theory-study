Proposition 5.3.5. Let P be a Suslin forcing. Every ≡ -class contains a
wb
virtual condition, which is unique up to ≡-equivalence.

Proof. Let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a weakly balanced condition; strengthening τ if necessary,
wemayassumethatτ isinfactanameforanelementofP. Letκbeanordinal

It is clear that the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,V ),σ(cid:105) is a P-pin. We will show that the pair
κ
(cid:104)Coll(ω,V ),σ(cid:105) is ≡ -related to (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105).

Unlike the balanced conditions, the weakly balanced virtual conditions can be
actually recognized in the ordering of virtual conditions by a natural first order
property.
Proposition 5.3.6. Let P be a Suslin forcing. Let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a P-pin. The
following are equivalent:
1. (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is weakly balanced;
2. (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is an atom in the ordering of virtual conditions.
