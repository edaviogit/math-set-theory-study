Finally, we include two examples of balanced posets which are not tethered.
Example 10.5.12. Let E be a non-smooth Borel pinned equivalence relation
on a Polish space X. The collapse poset P of |E| to 2ω of Definition 6.6.2 is
not tethered. Countable-to-one uniformization fails in the resulting extension
of the symmetric Solovay model.
Proof. We prove the last sentence. The poset P is balanced by the pinned
assumption on E and Corollary 6.6.4. In the P-extension of the symmetric
Solovay model, |E| ≤ |2ω| holds by the definition of the poset P. In addition,
|E | ≤ |E| holds by the Glimm–Effros dichotomy as E is assumed to be non-
0
smooth. In sum, |E | ≤ |2ω| holds, as witnessed by some function g: 2ω → 2ω.

In addition, Corollary 11.6.3 shows that in the P-extension of the symmetric
Solovay model, E has no transversal, and therefore the function g has no left
0
inverse. This feature of g stands witness to the failure of the countable-to-one
uniformization.
Example10.5.13. LetX beanuncountablePolishspace. TheKurepaposetP
of Definition 8.4.2 is not tethered. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay
model, countable-to-one uniformization fails.
Proof. For simplicity of notation, assume that X =2ω. Let W[F] be the sym-
metric Solovay model derived from an inaccessible cardinal κ, with the generic
