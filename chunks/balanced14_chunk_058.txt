2.5. CARDINAL INVARIANTS 57
Definition 2.5.22. LetE beananalyticequivalencerelationonaPolishspace
X and F be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space Y. EF is the
equivalencerelation(F×E)+ onthespace(Y ×X)ω restrictedtotheBorelset
{z ∈(Y ×X)ω: rng(z)isapartialfunctionfromY toX whosedomainconsists
of pairwise F-unrelated elements}.
It seems to be impossible to formulate this concept in an analytic form without
the additional demand that F be Borel.
Proposition 2.5.23. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish
space X and F be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space Y. Then
1. λ(EF)=λ(E)λ(F);
2. ifP isapartialordersuchthatP (cid:13)|λ(F)|=|κ(F)|=ℵ thenλ(EF,P)=
0
λ(E,P)λ(F).
Note that as F is assumed to be Borel, the value of λ(F) is not ∞.
Proof. Bothstatementsfollowfromtheclassificationofvirtualclassesforprod-
uct and Friedman–Stanley jump in Theorem 2.3.4. An EF-virtual class is rep-
resented by a function from F-virtual classes to E-virtual classes.
Example 2.5.24. Let F be any Borel equivalence relation with countably
0
many classes and let F be the identity on 2ω. For every Borel equivalence

relation E, EF1 is not Borel reducible to E×EF0.

Proof. Move to a model of set theory where c=ℵ and there is a cardinal κ>

(cid:105)

such that (κ+)ℵ1 > (κ+)ℵ0. The first such a cardinal must be in violation
ofthesingularcardinalhypothesisatcofinalityω . LetP =Coll(ω,κ). Clearly,

SinceE isBorel,λ(E),κ(E)<(cid:105) <κbyTheorem2.5.6,soProposition2.5.23
ω1
shows that λ(E ×EF0) = λ(E)·(κ+)ℵ0 = (κ+)ℵ0 < (κ+)ℵ1 = λ(EF1). The
ω1 ω1
argument is concluded by a reference to Theorem 2.5.4.
A similar argument with a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis at larger
cofinalities yields
Example 2.5.25. Let F be any Borel equivalence relation. For every Borel
equivalence relation E, EF+ is not Borel reducible to E×EF .
