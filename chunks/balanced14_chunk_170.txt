8.3. AUTOMORPHISMS OF P(ω) MODULO FINITE 179
Example 8.2.3. Suppose that Γ,∆ are abelian Polish groups, with Γ tor-
sion free and uncountable and ∆ divisible–the case Γ = R and ∆ = R/Z is
of particular interest. Then the poset P = P(Γ,∆) forces the generic homo-
morphism to be discontinuous. To see this, let p ∈ P be a condition. Let
(cid:104)γ : i ≤ ω(cid:105) be a sequence of elements of Γ which are linearly independent
i
over dom(p) and such that limγ = γ . Pick distinct elements δ,δ and let
i ω ω
q =p∪{(cid:104)γ ,δ(cid:105): i∈ω,(cid:104)γ ,δ (cid:105)}. It is immediate that q is a K(Γ,∆)-set, and it

forces γ to be a point of discontinuity of the generic homomorphism.

8.3 Automorphisms of P(ω) modulo finite
Automorphisms of the Boolean algebra P(ω) modulo finite have been investi-
gated for decades. The simply definable ones are trivial [98] and the Proper
Forcing Axiom implies that downright all automorphisms of the algebra are
trivial [83]. It turns out that there is a natural balanced poset for adding a
nontrivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra B =P(ω) modulo finite.
Definition 8.3.1. The automorphism poset P consists of pairs p = (cid:104)B ,π (cid:105)
p p
where B ⊂ B is a countable subalgebra and π is its automorphism. The
p p
ordering is that of coordinatewise reverse inclusion.
The automorphism poset is clearly σ-closed and Suslin. By a simple density
argument, it adds a nontrivial automorphism of the algebra B. This is an
immediate consequence of the following observation.
Fact 8.3.2. [9, Theorem 2.3] Let C ⊂B be a countable algebra and π: C →C
be an automorphism. Let χ: B → B be an automorphism. Then there is an
automorphism η: B →B extending π and not equal to χ.
The balanced virtual conditions in the poset P are naturally classified by au-
tomorphisms of the algebra B. Let π: B → B be such an automorphism, and

condition (cid:104)BV,πˇ(cid:105) ∈ P. The following theorem provides the key classification
information.
Theorem 8.3.3. Let P be the automorphism poset.
1. For every automorphism π of B, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,B),τ (cid:105) is balanced in
π
P;
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is an automorphism π of B such that
the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,B),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
π
3. distinct automorphisms yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
