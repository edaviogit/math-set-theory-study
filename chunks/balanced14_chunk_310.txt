13.1 m,n-centered and balanced forcings
In this chapter, we develop a tool which is particularly useful for ruling out
combinatorial objects with high degree of organization. The following notion is
central:
Definition 13.1.1. Let P be a Suslin poset and n∈m be numbers.
1. A virtual condition p¯in P is m,n-balanced if in every generic extension,
whenever {H : i ∈ m} are filters generic over V such that for every set
i
a ⊂ m of size n the filters {H : i ∈ a} are mutually generic over V, if
i
p ≤ p¯ are conditions in P in V[H ], then the set {p : i ∈ m} has a
i i i
common lower bound in P.
2. The poset P is m,n-balanced if for every condition p∈P there is a m,n-
balanced virtual condition p¯≤p.
As an initial example, let P be the poset of linear orderings on countable sets
ofE -classes, orderedbyreverseextension. Thebalancedvirtualconditionsare

classified by linear orderings of the E -quotient space. Each such ordering p¯is

The domains of the linear orderings p pairwise intersect in the set of ground

model E -classes; on this set, the orderings p agree and yield the ordering p¯.

(cid:83)
Therefore, it is possible to find a common linearization of p , which is their
i i
common lower bound.
Sometimes, a much simpler notion makes an appearance:
Definition 13.1.2. Let n ∈ m be numbers. A poset P is m,n-centered if
whenever a ⊂ P is a set of size m such that any subset of a of size n has a
common lower bound, then a has a common lower bound.
