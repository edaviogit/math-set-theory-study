is a condition p˙ of P which is below Σχ, and therefore also below Σσ and Στ.

This is a contradiction.
For the (2)→(1) direction, suppose that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a P-pin which is an atom
in the ordering of virtual conditions. To prove the weak balance, suppose that

Finally, we record the central definition of this section.
