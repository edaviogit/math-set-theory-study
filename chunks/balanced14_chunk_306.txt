a Bernstein balanced virtual condition.
Note that a soft poset P must have the following centeredness property: if
B ⊂ P is a countable centered set, then B has a lower bound. To see this,

just extend it into an Bernstein balanced centered set C ⊂P, note that in the
Coll(ω,C)-extension, the set C has a lower bound by the definition, and by a
Mostowski absoluteness argument the set B must have a lower bound already
in the ground model.
Theorem 12.4.2. Suppose that there is a weakly compact Woodin cardinal.
Suppose that P is a soft Suslin forcing. Then there is a filter G ⊂ P which is
generic over the model L(R).
Proof. LetB ⊂P beacenteredsetofsize<c,andletD ⊂P beanopendense
set in L(R). We will show that there is a condition p ∈ D such that {p}∪B
is a centered set. The theorem then follows by a straightforward transfinite
recursion construction, given the fact that there are only c-many subsets of P
in the model of L(R) as soon as a measurable cardinal exists. So, let C ⊃B be
an Bernstein balanced centered set witnessing the definitory properties of the
softposetP. ThesetD isdefinablefromarealparameterinthemodelL(R#).
Below, we identify the set D with its definition.

Let j: V → M be the generic ultrapower associated with K; the model M
is closed under ω-sequences. Work in the model M. The closure properties
of the model M guarantee that the following objects belong to the model M:
the collection {H : y ∈ 2ω}, the collection {P ∩V[H ]: y ∈ Y}, and the map

Thus, there must be a condition p ∈ D∩V[H ], p ≤ C. By the choice of the
y
point y ∈ Y, the set {p}∪j(C) is centered. Thus M |= there is a condition
p∈D such that {p}∪j(C) is centered. By the elementarity of the embedding
j, M |= there is a condition p∈D such that {p}∪C is centered; in particular,
{p}∪B is centered as desired.
The following examples all use the Woodin cardinal assumption which is not
spelled out.
