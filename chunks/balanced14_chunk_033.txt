h: X →Y such that ∀x ,x ∈X x E x iff h(x )F h(x ).

The most permissive comparison of equivalence relations is the one which com-
pares just the cardinalities of the quotient spaces. The following abuse of nota-
tion is used throughout:
Definition 1.7.3. If E is an equivalence relation on a Polish space X then the
E-quotient space is the set of all E-equivalence classes. Moreover, |E| denotes
the cardinality of the E-quotient space.

In choiceless context though, the dichotomies satisfying the latter disjunct may

Analytic hypergraphs. A hypergraph on a set X is an arbitrary subset Γ⊂
P(X) consisting of nonempty sets. As a matter of convention, our hypergraphs
do not contain any singleton sets. The elements of Γ will be called hyperedges
whiletheelementsofX willbecalledvertices. Ahypergraphisfinitary ifallof
its hyperedges are finite sets. It is a graph if all its hyperedges have cardinality
two. AΓ-anticlique isasetA⊂X suchthatΓ∩P(A)=0. AΓ-coloring isany
function with domain X which is not constant on any hyperedge; the elements
of the range of a coloring are referred to as colors. The chromatic number χ(Γ)
of the hypergraph Γ is the smallest cardinal number κ such that there is a Γ-
coloring with at most κ-many colors. This definition makes sense only in the
contextoftheAxiomofChoiceinwhichcardinalitiesarewell-ordered;therefore,
χ(Γ) must exist. In a choiceless context, only a limited version is available: we
discern between countable and uncountable chromatic number, and the various
values of the countable chromatic numbers.
We will be interested in analytic finitary hypergraphs. Say that Γ⊂[X]<ℵ0
is an analytic hypergraph if X is Polish and the set {y ∈ Xω: rng(y) ∈ Γ} is
analytic. TheBorelchromaticnumber ofΓiscountableifX canbedecomposed

Forcing. A great part of this book is devoted to forcing. The words forcing,
poset, or partially ordered set are treated as synonyms. A condition is any
element of a partially ordered set. We use the Boolean notation: q ≤ p means
that the condition q is stronger, more informative than p. Now, let P be a
partially ordered set. For a set A⊂P and a condition p∈P, we write p≤ΣA

element of A. The formula P (cid:13) φ denotes the statement that every condition
p ∈ P, p (cid:13) φ. Whenever P is a partial ordering, τ is a P-name, and G ⊂ P is
