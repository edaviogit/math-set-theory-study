5.2. BALANCED CONDITIONS 127
(cid:81)
Theorem 5.2.9. Let P = P be a countable support product of Suslin
n n
forcing notions. Balanced conditions in P are exactly classified by sequences
(cid:104)p : n∈ω(cid:105) where for every n∈ω, p is a balanced condition in P .
n n n
Proof. Ononehand, if(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)arebalancedpairsforeachn∈ω, thenamefor
n n
(cid:81)
the sequence (cid:104)τ : n ∈ ω(cid:105) in the product Q = Q is balanced for the poset
n n n
P essentially by the definitions. The choice of the support in the product Q is
immaterial. Ontheotherhand,ifQisaposetandτ =(cid:104)τ : n∈ω(cid:105)isabalanced

is balanced for the poset P . It equally easy to see that equivalent balanced
n
names for P give equivalent balanced names on each coordinate, and sequences
of balanced names on the posets P which are coordinatewise equivalent yield
n
equivalent balanced names for the product forcing.
Corollary 5.2.10. The countable support product of balanced Suslin forcings is
balanced.
One issue that is constantly present in this book is the lack of absoluteness
of the notions surrounding balance. As long as Question 5.2.6 remains open,
it will also be necessary to relativize the definition of a balanced poset to V
κ
where κ is an inaccessible cardinal. One may think that with suitable large
cardinal hypothesis on κ, one could use reflection to show that relativization is
unnecessary. The best result we have in this direction is
Proposition 5.2.11. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Let κ be a strong cardinal.
The following are equivalent:
1. P is balanced;
2. V |=P is balanced.
κ
Proof. The argument uses two simple absoluteness claims of independent inter-
est:
Claim 5.2.12. If M is a transitive model of ZFC, (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a pair in M and
the pair is balanced in V, then it is balanced in M.
Proof. Immediate by Mostowski absoluteness between generic extensions of M
and V.
Claim 5.2.13. If M is a transitive model of ZFC, (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a pair in M, M |=
(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is balanced, and P(Q)⊂M, then the pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is balanced in V.
Proof. Work in V. Suppose that the conclusion fails, as witnessed by posets
