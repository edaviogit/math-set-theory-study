It is now time to exhibit some virtual conditions for familiar partial orders.
Example 5.1.5. Let P be the poset of infinite subsets of ω, ordered by in-
clusion. Let F be a nonprincipal filter on ω. Let τ be a Coll(ω,F)-name for
the set of all conditions p ∈ P which diagonalize the filter F, i.e. ∀a ∈ F p\a
is finite. The name τ is P-pinned, since its valuation does not depend on the
choice of the generic filter on Coll(ω,F). It is not difficult to see that distinct
nonprincipal filters generate distinct virtual conditions.
Example 5.1.6. Let P be the poset of all countable functions from 2ω to 2,
ordered by reverse inclusion. Let f be any function from 2ω to 2, perhaps
uncountable. Letτ beaColl(ω,f)-nameforthesetofallconditionsp∈P such
that f ⊂p. Again, the name τ is P-pinned. It is clear that distinct functions f
generate distinct virtual conditions in P.
For many Suslin orders there exist virtual conditions which can be classified by
natural combinatorial objects. In particular, this holds quite often for balanced
virtual conditions, which are introduced in the following section and are the
central topic of this book.
Proposition 5.1.7. Suppose that (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) is a σ-closed Suslin poset such that
below any element p∈P there are two incompatible ones. Then the equivalence
≡ has proper class many equivalence classes.
Proof. Leth: 2<ω →P beafunctionsuchthatforeveryt∈ω<ω,theconditions

2n such that p ≤ h(t), and the binary relation g(cid:48)(cid:48){n ∈ ω: t(p,n+1)(n) = 1}
is isomorphic to α. It is not difficult to see that the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,α),τ (cid:105) is
