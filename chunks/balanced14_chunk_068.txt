that τ/G E σ/H. To see this, observe that the filters η/G ⊂ R and H ⊂ R
are mutually generic over the model M, so M[η/G,H]|=σ/η/GE σ/H as the
name σ is E-pinned and M is an elementary submodel. σ/η/G = τ/G E σ/H

For the harder direction (1) implies (2), first fix a Polish group Γ, an action

E to the orbit equivalence relation F induced by the action of Γ. Suppose that
σ is an E-pinned name on P such that the E-pin (cid:104)P,σ(cid:105) belongs to c. Consider
the Cohen poset P of nonempty open subsets of Γ, with its associated name
Γ
γ˙ for a generic element of Γ. Consider the product P ×P and the poset
gen Γ
Q, the subset of the complete Boolean algebra of P ×P which is generated by
Γ
the name τ for γ˙ ·h˙(σ), an element of the space Y. Since the poset P is
gen Γ
countable, it preserves all cardinals. Therefore, to show that P collapses κ, it
will be enough to show that Q collapses κ.
Claim 2.6.5. Let H ⊂ Q be a generic filter. In V[H], P forces the point
Γ
γ˙ ·τ/H ∈Y to be Q-generic over V[H].
gen
The difficulty resides in the assertion that the point is forced to be Q-generic
over V[H] and not just over V.
Proof. Let γ ,γ ,γ ∈ Γ and K ,K ⊂ P be P -generic points and generic

filters on P respectively, which are in addition mutually generic. Since σ is
an E-pinned name, σ/K E σ/K holds. Since h is a reduction of E to F,

Now, let H ⊂ Q be a generic filter, and work in V[H]. Since the poset
P has a countable dense subset and it introduces a generic for Q, it must be
Γ
the case that Q has a countable dense subset as well. Back in V, the forcing
theorem says that Q forces Qˇ to have a countable dense subset. Fix a Q-
name η for a function from ω to Q whose range is forced to be dense, and let
D ={q ∈Q: ∃r ∃m∈ω r (cid:13)η(m)=qˇ}. Itwillbeenoughtoshowthat|D|≥κ
