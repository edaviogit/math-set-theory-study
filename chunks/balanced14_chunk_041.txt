⊂ Xmj+1 is an analytic relation which is invariant
under E, and in the E-quotient space it is a graph of a function.
The quotient structure M is Borel if all the relations above including E are
Borel.

40 CHAPTER 2. THE VIRTUAL REALM
There are many popular examples of analytic quotient structures. If (cid:104)G,·(cid:105)
is a Polish group and H ⊂G is an analytic normal subgroup, one can form the
quotientgroupG/H. If(cid:104)X,≤(cid:105)isananalyticpartialordering, onecanformthe
separativequotientundertheassumptionthatthequotientequivalencerelation
is analytic. Embeddability of countable structures forms an ordering on the
quotients space of all countable structures modulo the equivalence relation of
biembeddability etc.
If M = (cid:104)X,E,R : i ∈ ω,f : j ∈ ω(cid:105) is an analytic quotient structure, then
i j
we write M∗ = (cid:104)X∗,R∗: i ∈ ω,f∗: j ∈ ω(cid:105) for its associated structure on the
i j
actual quotient space X/E of all E-classes.
Definition 2.2.2. Let M = (cid:104)X,E,R : i ∈ ω,f : j ∈ ω(cid:105) be an analytic quo-

The first proposition says that Definition 2.2.2 is sound and that we receive
a structure with the same signature as the original one:
Proposition 2.2.3. The definition of R∗∗ and f∗∗ does not depend on the
i j
choice of representatives of the virtual classes. Moreover, f is a graph of a
j
(total) function.
Proof. The statements “R ,f are E-invariant relations” and “f is a graph of
i j j
a total function in the quotient” are Π1; therefore, they are absolute between

V and all forcing extensions. The first sentence of the proposition immediately
follows. Forthesecondsentence, supposethatthefunctionf hasaritym and

(cid:104)(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105): k ∈m (cid:105) is a tuple of E-pins. Let Q= Q and let τ be a Q-name
k k j k k
for an element of X such that f (τ : k ∈ m ,τ) is forced to hold. Since in the
j k j
Q×Q-extension, f is a graph of a function on the quotient and the names τ

the tuple (cid:104)(cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105): k ∈ m ,(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105)(cid:105) belongs to f∗∗ and the second sentence of
k k j j
the proposition follows.
In the case of an analytic quotient structure, it is possible that its virtual
version is a proper class. In particular, it is possible to express the whole

Example 2.4.6. However, if the equivalence relation E is Borel then the virtual
version is a set of size < (cid:105) by Theorem 2.5.6. In any case, it is possible to

stratify M∗∗ into set sized pieces:
