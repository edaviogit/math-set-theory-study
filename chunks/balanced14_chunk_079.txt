g holds in the Solovay model derived from a
measurable cardinal. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. The following are equivalent:
1. E is unpinned;
2. F ≤E or E ≤ E.

Proof. LetκbeameasurablecardinalandletW bethederivedSolovaymodel.
In W, (2) certainly implies (1) as the proofs that F ,E are unpinned work in
2 ω1
ZF, and the proof that pinned equivalence relations persist downwards in the
reducibility orderings works in ZF+DC.
Fortheimplication(1)→(2), assumethatW |=E isunpinned. Theremust
be a poset P and a nontrivial E-pinned name τ on the poset P, both in W.
Both P and τ must be definable in W from a ground model parameter z ∈2ω.
For simplicity of the notation assume that z ∈ V. Return to V. Let Q be the
two-step iteration Coll(ω,<κ)∗P˙, and write σ for the Q-name obtained from
the P˙-name τ. There are two cases.

transfer the almost reducibility to the Solovay model. To simplify the notation
assume that q is the largest element of the poset Q.
Observe that the name σ cannot be E¯-equivalent to any name on a poset
of size < κ. Suppose for contradiction that R is a poset of size < κ and χ
an E-pinned R-name such that (cid:104)R,χ(cid:105) E¯ (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105). In W, let H ⊂ R be a filter
generic over V. By Proposition 2.1.5 applied over V, W |=P (cid:13)τ E χ/H. This
contradicts the assumption that V[G]|=P (cid:13)∀x∈X∩V[G] ¬τ E x.
Now,itfollowsthatκ(E)≥κ. ByTheorem2.5.6(2),sinceκisameasurable
cardinal, κ(E)=∞. By Theorem 2.8.9, E ≤ E as desired.

Case 2. For every condition q ∈Q, the Q(cid:22)q-name σ is not E-pinned. In this
case,wewillconcludethatF isreducibletoE. Then,aShoenfieldabsoluteness

argument shows that the Borel reduction of F to E remains a Borel reduction

also in the Solovay model.
Fix a countable elementary submodel M of a large structure containing the
code for E, the posets P,Q and the name τ. Write R=Coll(ω,<κ)∩M. Let
Z =2ω, and use Proposition 1.7.8 to find a Borel function G from Z to P(M)
such that for every finite set a⊂Z the filters G(z)⊂R for z ∈a are mutually
generic over M. For every set a ⊂ Z write 2ω = (cid:83) {2ω ∩M[ (cid:81) G(z)]: b ⊂ a
