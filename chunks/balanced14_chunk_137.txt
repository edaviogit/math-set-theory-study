b). Let a(cid:48) ⊂a be inclusion minimal superset of a∩b such that x∈f(a(cid:48)).
Note that a(cid:48) (cid:54)⊂ a∩b, choose a point y ∈ a(cid:48)\(a∩b), and let a(cid:48)(cid:48) = a(cid:48)\{y}. By

the exchange property of the pre-geometry, it follows that y ∈f(a(cid:48)(cid:48)∪{x}). By
the monotonicity and idempotence of the pre-geometry, y ∈f(a(cid:48)(cid:48)∪b) and since
y ∈a∪b and y ∈/ a(cid:48)(cid:48)∪b, this means that a∪b∈/ K. This direction does not use
the modularity assumption on the pre-geometry.
Now suppose that a∪b∈/ K and work to show that f(a)∩f(b)(cid:54)=f(a∩b).
Letcbeaninclusionminimalsubsetofa∪bsuchthata∩b⊂c,cisfree,andfor

Tothisend,letd⊂c∪{x}beminimalsuchthatthereisy ∈(c∪{x})\dwhich
is in f(d). If x ∈/ d then y must be equal to x by the freeness of the set c; and
if x∈d, then by the exchange property x∈f(d∪{y}\{x}), so x∈f(c) again.
Now, assume for definiteness that x∈b. Let a(cid:48) =c\b and b(cid:48) =c∩b. Since
x ∈ f(a(cid:48) ∪b(cid:48)), the modularity assumption on the pre-geometry yields points
x ∈ f(a(cid:48)) and x ∈ f(b(cid:48)) such that x ∈ f(x ,x ). Note that {x ,x } ∈ K: if

for example x ∈ f({x }), then by idempotence x ∈ f(a(cid:48)), by the exchange

property there would have to be some element z ∈ a(cid:48) such that z ∈ f({x }∪

(a(cid:48)\{z})), and by idempotence again z ∈f(c\{z}), contradicting the freeness

By the modularity, there have to be points y,z such that y ∈ f(a(cid:48)), z ∈ f(b(cid:48))
and x ∈ f(y,z). By the exchange property, y ∈ f(z,x) ⊂ f(b). At the same
time, y ∈M and so by the maximality of the set A and the elementarity of the
model M, there has to be d⊂A in the model M such that y ∈f(d). In total,
y ∈ f(b)∩f(d), by the initial assumption on the set b b∪d ∈ K holds, and by
themodularityofthefunctionf,y ∈f(b∩d)⊂f(b(cid:48)). Thenx∈f(y,z)⊂f(b(cid:48)),
contradicting the freeness of the set b.
Example 6.4.9. (A linear matroid) Let X be a Borel vector space over a
countable field, and let K be the matroid of finite linearly independent subsets
of X. The pre-geometry of K is well-known to be modular, so the simplicial
complex K is modular. Let P be the poset of countable linearly independent
sets. The balanced conditions in P are classified by bases of X over the field.
