A good example of a projection is any complete subalgebra of a complete
Boolean algebra. The point of the current definition is that the property of

being projective is first order in A,B, so (unlike completeness) transfers from
modeltomodelwithoutdamage. NotethatifA⊂B isaprojectivesubalgebra,
then every maximal antichain of A is also a maximal antichain of B; therefore,
the intersection of a generic filter on B with A will be a generic filter on A. To
see this, let D ⊂A be a maximal antichain of A and b∈B be a condition. Let
d ∈ D be an element of A compatible with π(b). Then π(b)−d ∈ A is strictly
smaller element of A than π(b), so π(b)−d(cid:54)≥b holds. This means that d and b
must be compatible.

The above notions have the slightly unpleasant feature that they do not
necessarily survive localization well, so an additional local definition is needed.
