he balanced pairs
(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(X)),Aˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct sets as in (1) yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.

182 CHAPTER 8. OTHER FORCINGS
Proof. For (1), fix a set A ⊂ P(X) closed under finite intersections and con-
taining the set X. Suppose that V[H ],V[H ] are mutually generic extensions
0 1
of the ground model V in which the set P(X)∩V is countable. Suppose that
p ∈ V[H ] and p ∈ V[H ] are conditions stronger than A; we must show
0 0 1 1
that p ,p ∈ P are compatible, in other words that p ∪ p ∈ P. To this
0 1 0 1
end, let a ∈ p and a ∈ p be sets; we must show that a ∩a ∈ p ∩p .

To see this, first the product forcing theorem shows that a ∩ a ⊂ V ∩ X
0 1
holds. Second, both sets a ∩V ∩X and a ∩V ∩X must belong to A, since
0 1
V ∩X ∈ A and A ≤ p ,p . Since A is closed under finite intersections, we see

thata ∩a =(a ∩V)∩(a ∩V)∈A⊂p ∩p holds. Therefore,theconditions

p ,p are compatible as desired.

the condition τ repeatedly in the Q-extension if necessary, we may assume that
for each set a ⊂ X in the ground model, either a ∈ τ or there is b ∈ τ such
that a∩b ∈/ τ. A balance argument shows that for each set a ⊂ X in the
ground model, the largest condition in Q decides which alternative prevails.
Let A ⊂ P(X) be a set of all sets a ⊂ X for which the former alternative pre-
vails. We will show that A is a set closed under finite intersections containing
X, and Q (cid:13) Aˇ ≥ τ. The desired equivalence of (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(X)),Aˇ(cid:105)
then follows from Proposition 5.2.4.
The closure of the set A under finite intersections follows immediately from
the fact that Q forces τ to be closed under finite intersections. To see that
X ∈ A holds, suppose towards a contradiction that it fails; so there must be a
Q-nameσ forasubsetofX suchthatQ(cid:13)σ ∈τ andσ∩V ∈/ τ. Strengthenthe
name τ if necessary to contain a set which contains X ∩V as a subset, and let
η be a Q-name for such a set in τ. Let H ,H ⊂Q be mutually generic filters,
0 1
let p =τ/H and p =τ/H , and let a =η/H and a =σ/H . By a mutual
0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
genericity argument, a ∩a = (a ∩V)∩(a ∩V) = a ∩V. It follows that
0 1 0 1 1
a ∩a ∈/ p and so p ,p are incompatible conditions in P, contradicting the
0 1 1 0 1
balance assumption.
Finally, to show that Q(cid:13)τ ≤Aˇ, suppose towards a contradiction that this
fails. Passing to a condition in Q if necessary we may find a set b ∈ A and a
Q-name σ such that Q (cid:13) σ ∈ τ and σ∩ˇb ∈/ Aˇ. Now proceed similarly to the
previous paragraph. Strengthen the name τ if necessary to contain a set which
contains X ∩V as a subset, and let η be a Q-name for such a set in τ. Let
H ,H ⊂ Q be mutually generic filters, let p = τ/H and p = τ/H , and let
0 1 0 0 1 1
a = η/H and a = σ/H . By a mutual genericity argument, a ∩b∩a =
0 0 1 1 0 1
(a ∩b)∩(a ∩b) = a ∩b. Now, if a ∩b ∈ V, then a ∩b ∈ A, contradicting
0 1 1 1 1
the choice of the name σ. Thus, it must be the case that a ∩b∈/ V, and by a

p ,p are incompatible conditions in P, contradicting the balance assumption.

Finally,(3)isobvious. ThebalanceoftheposetP followsfrom(1): ifp∈P
is a condition then (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),p∪{X∩V}(cid:105) is a balanced pair below p.
