332 CHAPTER 13. THE ARITY DIVIDE
Theorem 13.2.4. Let (cid:104)Γ,·(cid:105) be an uncountable Polish group such that the map
γ (cid:55)→γ·γ is a self-homeomorphism of Γ. In cofinally 3,2-balanced extensions of
the symmetric Solovay model, for every coloring c: Γ→ω there is a solution to
the equation xy = zz consisting of monochromatic, pairwise distinct points in
Γ.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset which is
cofinally3,2-balancedbelowκ. LetW bethesymmetricSolovaymodelderived
from κ and work in W. Let τ be a P-name and p ∈ P be a condition forcing
τ to be a map from Γ to ω. We must find a solution to the equation xx = yz
consisting of pairwise distinct points and a condition stronger than p which
forces the point of the solution to have all the same color.
The name τ and the condition p must both be definable with parameters in
thegroundmodelandanotherparametersz ∈2ω. LetV[K]beanintermediate
model obtained by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ such that z ∈ V[K]
and P is 3,2-balanced in V[K]. Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a
3,2-balancedvirtualcondition. LetP betheCohenposetonthegroupΓwith

number n ∈ ω, a P ×Coll(ω,λ)-name σ and a condition O ∈ P such that

Let γ ∈O be an arbitrary point, and let δ ∈Γ be a point so close (but not
equal) to the unit that both γδ and δ−1γ belong to the open set O ⊂ Γ. Note
that the points γδ, δ−1γ, and γ are pairwise distinct and solve the equation
xy = zz. (If γδ = δ−1γ then the square of this point would give the same
result as γγ, contradicting the assumption that the squaring function is a self-
homeomorphism, in particular a bijective self-map, of Γ.) Let O ,O ,O ⊂ O
0 1 2
be pairwise disjoint open sets separating these three points, and let X¯ = {x¯ ∈
O × O × O : x¯(0)x¯(1) = x¯(2)x¯(2)}. This is a relatively closed subset of
0 1 2
O × O × O . Moreover, each coordinate of a point in X¯ is a continuous
0 1 2
function of the other two (in the case of the third coordinate this again uses
the assumption that the squaring function is a self-homeomorphism of Γ) and
therefore the projection maps from X¯ into any pair of coordinates are open
maps from X¯ to Γ2.
Consider the Cohen poset P X¯. Let x¯ ∈ X¯ be a triple of points which is
P X¯-genericoverthemodelV[K]. UseProposition3.1.1toseethatthesepoints
are pairwise mutually P -generic below the condition O. Let H ⊂ Coll(ω,λ)

i i i
Since the extensions V[K][x¯(i)][H ] for i∈3 are pairwise mutually generic, the
i
balance assumption on the virtual condition p¯shows that the conditions p for
i
i ∈ 3 have a common lower bound, say r ∈ P. By the forcing theorem applied
in the respective models V[K][x¯(i)][H ] for i ∈ 3, we see that r forces all three
i
points in the triple x¯ to have the same color n. At the same time, the triple
solves the equation xy =zz as required.
Finally, we move to the much better organized world of 3,2-centered forcings.
