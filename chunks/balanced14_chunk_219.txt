Note that the Polish assumption on the vector space Y is necessary in Corol-
lary 9.4.30. One can consider the (non-Polishable) group Y of finite subsets of
2ω equipped with the symmetric difference operation as a vector space over the
binaryfield. ThisvectorspacehasabasisinZF,namelythesetofallsingletons.
Thus, the existence of the basis for this particular vector space does not imply
in ZF the existence of a complete countable section for E .

relation is Borel reducible to it by a result of Rosendal [74]. It is well-known
that the equivalence relation Eω is not Borel reducible to E [48, Lemma

6.1.1], and among the equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures,
it even has a central place in this regard. In this section, we show that in
certain extensions of the symmetric Solovay model, this non-reducibility result
is translated to a cardinality preservation result. The reader should note that
in ZF, the inequality |E | ≤ |2ω| implies |Eω| ≤ |(2ω)ω| = |2ω|, and therefore

preserving the E -divide is strictly more difficult than preserving the smooth

The preservation of the relation |Eω|(cid:54)≤|E | uses the following generaliza-
