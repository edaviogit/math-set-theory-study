Chapter 4
Nested sequences of models
4.1 Prologue
The purpose of this chapter is to set up a calculus for infinite nested sequences
of models of ZFC, which turn out to be critical for the treatment of the E
1
cardinal. As a motivation, we include a simple proof of the fact that E is not
1
Borel reducible to any orbit equivalence relation. It is quite different from the
standardone[48,Theorem11.8.1],andithastheadvantagethatitcanbeeasily
adapted to the context of inequalities between cardinalities of quotient spaces.
Theorem 4.1.1. E is not Borel reducible to any orbit equivalence relation.
1
Proof. Let Y be the Polish space (2ω)ω and Γ be a Polish group continuously
acting on a Polish space Z, inducing the orbit equivalence relation F. Suppose
towards a contradiction that there is a Borel reduction h: Y → Z of E to F.

Work in the model M . The reinterpretation of the Borel map h in M is

still a reduction of E to F. For each number n>0 fix a group element γ ∈Γ

suchthatγ ·h(y )=h(y ). Letγ ∈ΓbeapointCohen-genericoverV[y ]and

look into the model V[γ·h(y )]. By a Mostowski absoluteness argument, there
0
must be a point y ∈ V[γ·h(y )] such that h(y) F γ·h(y ). Since the function
0 0
h is a reduction of E to F even in the model M [γ], this point y ∈ Y must
1 0
be E -related to y , so for all but finitely many numbers n it must be the case
1 0
that y(n) = x . Choose a number n ∈ ω such that y(n) = x and look at the
n n
model M . The point γγ ∈Γ is Cohen generic over M by the invariance
n+1 n+1 0
of the meager ideal under right shift, and by the product forcing theorem it
follows that the models M and M [γγ ] are mutually generic over the
0 n+1 n+1
model M . Now, the points y and γγ ·h(y ) = γ·h(y ) belong to
n+1 n+1 n+1 n+1 0
the model M [γγ ] and so does y. Thus, even the point y(n) = x ∈ 2ω
n+1 n+1 n
belongs to this model; however, it is a point of M Cohen generic over M .
0 n+1
This contradicts the product forcing theorem.
