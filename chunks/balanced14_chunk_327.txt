14.2 Unbounded linear suborders
Another general obstruction for reaching ZF independence results in balanced
extensionsisencapsulatedinthefollowingtheorem,statedusingConvention1.7.16.
Theorem 14.2.1. Let (cid:69) be an F -preorder on a Polish space X with no max-
σ
imal element such that every countable linearly ordered set has an upper bound.
In cofinally balanced σ-closed extensions of the symmetric Solovay model, (cid:69)
contains no unbounded linearly ordered sets.

Proof. Westart witha simple claimwhichtakes place inthe contextof ZFC. If
R is a poset and η is an R-name for an element of X, say that η is unbounded
if R forces that for every ground model element x∈X, η(cid:69)x fails.
Claim 14.2.2. Suppose that R ,R are posets and η ,η are respective un-

bounded names for elements of X. Then R ×R (cid:13)τ ,τ are (cid:69)-incomparable.

Proof. Let (cid:69) = (cid:83) F where for every n ∈ ω, F is closed. If the conclusion

By the forcing theorem, there must be a condition r(cid:48) ∈ g below r such that

Now, let κ be an inaccessible cardinal and P be a σ-closed Suslin forcing
which is balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ. Suppose towards a contradiction that the conclusion of the
theorem fails in the P-extension of W. Then, in the model W there must be
a condition p ∈ P and a P-name τ such that p (cid:13) τ ⊂ X is an (cid:69)-unbounded
linearly ordered set. The condition p as well as the name τ must be definable
from some parameter z ∈ 2ω and some parameters in the ground model. Let
V[K] be a generic extension of the ground model by a poset of size < κ such
that p,z ∈V[K] and P is balanced in V[K].
Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯≤ p be a balanced condition in the poset
P. Since Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p (cid:13) τ is an unbounded set in ≤, for every element
x ∈ X ∩V the set τ is forced to contain an element which is not (cid:69)x. Since
Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p (cid:13) X ∩V[K] is a countable set and DC holds, τ is forced to
containacountablesubsetsuchthatnoelementofX∩V[K]isanupperbound
of it. By the initial assumptions on the preorder (cid:69), this countable set is forced
to have an upper bound in τ, which is then an element of τ which is not (cid:69)x
