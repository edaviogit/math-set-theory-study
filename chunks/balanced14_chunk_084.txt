3.2 Examples
Several groups of results in this book depend on an identification of a suitable
pair of independent maps. The most important example comes from Hjorth’s
notion of turbulence of group actions. Recall the standard definition:
Definition3.2.1. [48,Section13.1]LetΓbeaPolishgroupcontinuouslyacting
on a Polish space Y.
1. IfU ⊂Γ,O ⊂Y aresetsthenaU,O-walk isasequence(cid:104)y : i≤k,γ : i<
i i
k(cid:105) such that for each i ≤ k y ∈ O holds, and for each i < k γ ∈ U and
i i
y =γ ·y both hold;
i+1 i i
2. if y ∈ O then U,O-orbit of y is the set of all z ∈ O such that there is a
U,O-walk starting at y and ending at z;
3. the action is turbulent at y ∈ Y if for all open sets U ⊂ Γ and O ⊂ X
with 1∈U and y ∈O the U,O-orbit of y is somewhere dense;
4. the action is generically turbulent if its orbits are meager and dense and
the set of points of turbulence is comeager.
Now, suppose that Γ is a Polish group acting continuously on a Polish space Y.

X can be viewed as a graph of a continuous function of any pair of coordinates

notation in hand, we prove:
Theorem 3.2.2. Let Γ be a Polish group continuously acting on a Polish space
Y such that all orbits are meager and dense. The following are equivalent:
1. the action is generically turbulent;
2. f ,f : X →Y is an independent pair of functions;

Proof. For the implication (1)→(2), suppose that the action is generically tur-
bulent. Let O ⊂X be a nonempty open set. Find a point δ ∈Γ and open sets
