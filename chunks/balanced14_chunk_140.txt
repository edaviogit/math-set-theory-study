both clearly belong to Q(b ,b ).

Then the recovery follows from the string of equalities y =w(z−1)−1, x=zy,
t=(xt)x−1 and s=(x+s)−x. (This elegant argument was pointed out to us
by Peter Sin.)

existenceofaninjectivefunctiong: a→X suchthat∀u∈af(u)∈u. Toverify
that (*) is satisfied, select pairwise distinct points y ,y and x for α ∈ ω of

the underlying space X, let a={{y },{y }} and b ={{y ,x },{y ,x }}.

Example 6.4.15. Let X be an uncountable Polish space and let K be the
simplicialcomplexon[X]2consistingofthosefinitesetsa⊂[X]2suchthatthere
is no set b∈[X]3 such that [b]2 ⊂a. The associated poset P adds a maximal
K
triangle-free graph on X. The simplicial complex K satisfies (*); therefore, it
is not modular. To see this, let x ,x ∈ X be any distinct points and let
0 1
a={{x ,x }}. For each z ∈X distinct from x ,x let b ={{x ,z},{x ,z}}.

It is easy to check that {a,b : z ∈X} exemplify (*).

sets a ⊂ X such that a is infinite. The associated poset P adds a Ramsey
K
ultrafilter. The simplicial complex K satisfies (*) and so is not modular. To see
this, let F be any filter on ω which is not generated by countably many sets.
Let a ⊂ ω be an infinite set such that the complement of a is in F, and let b

for α∈ω be pairwise distinct elements of F disjoint from a. It is not difficult

to verify that the sets {a},{b }: α∈ω exemplify (*).

The examples above are selected so that the associated poset P is always
K
balanced. Since the criterion (*) rules out an arbitrary modular function as
opposed to a Borel modular function, and in general the modular functions
seem to be very difficult to construct by transfinite recursion procedures, the
following question suggests itself:

Theorem 6.4.18. Let K be a Borel modular simplicial complex on a Polish
space X such that its modular function takes only finite values. Then every
countable K-set can be extended to a strongly maximal K-set.
Proof. LetC ⊂X beacountableK-set. Letf: K→[Y]<ℵ0 beaBorelmodular
function. Let κ be the cardinality of the continuum, and let {B : α∈κ} be an
α
enumeration of all Borel subsets of K. By recursion on α ∈ κ construct K-sets
C so that
