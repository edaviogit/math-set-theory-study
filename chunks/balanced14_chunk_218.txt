228 CHAPTER 9. PRESERVING CARDINALITIES
Let ≤ be the preordering on X defined by x ≤x if x ∈L[x ,A]. In view of
1 0 1 0
Theorem 9.4.28 it will be enough to show that ≤ is well-founded.
To do this, consider the map π: X → ω defined by π(x) = ωL[x,A]. It
1 1
will be enough to show that x < x implies π(x ) ∈ π(x ). Suppose towards
1 0 1 0
contradiction that this fails for some x < x , and write M = L[x ,A] and
1 0 1 1
M =L[x ,A]. Since M is a class of M , it must be the case that ωM1 ≤ωM0;
0 0 1 0 1 1
by the contradictory assumption, the equality in fact prevails. Thus, in the
model M the set Y ∩M is an uncountable proper subset of Y ∩M . Let
0 1 0
y ∈Y ∩(M \M ) be an arbitrary point.

By a counting argument in the model M there must be a number m ∈ ω

and distinct points z ,z ∈Y ∩M such that c(y,z )=c(y,z )=m. If y ∈Y
0 1 1 0 1
was the unique point satisfying these equalities then it can be constructed from
A and the points z ,z ; as such, it would belong to the model M , which is not
0 1 1
the case. Thus, there is a point y(cid:48) ∈ Y distinct from y such that c(y(cid:48),z ) =
0
c(y(cid:48),z ) = m. However, then the 4-cycle consisting of edges connecting the
1
vertices z ,y,z ,y(cid:48),z in this order is monochromatic, a contradiction.

Corollary 9.4.30. (ZF) Let Y be an uncountable Polish vector space over a
countable field Φ. If there is a basis for Y over Φ then there is a countable
complete section for E .

In particular, in ZF the existence of a Hamel basis for R over Q implies |E |≤

|F |.

Proof. Let d be an invariant complete metric on Y. Let B ⊂ Y be a basis for
Y over F. Let A = {(cid:104)y,O : i ∈ k(cid:105): y ∈ Y,O ⊂ Y are basic open sets and
i i
there are points y ∈ O ∩b such that y is a linear combination of y : i ∈ k

with nonzero coefficients in Φ}. Define a preordering on the space X by setting
x ≤x if x ∈L[x ,A,B]. It will be enough to show that the preordering ≤ is
1 0 1 0
well-founded. A reference to Theorem 9.4.28 then concludes the proof.
Suppose towards contradiction that the ordering ≤ is ill-founded. The first

there is a strictly decreasing sequence in ≤ below x . The point here is that

Write M for the model L[x ,A,B] and M for M . As an initial ob-
