Corollary 11.6.3. Let P be the collapse poset of E to 2ω.

1. In the P-extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of the
diagonal Hamming graph is uncountable;
2. it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds and
|E |≤|2ω| and yet the chromatic number of the diagonal Hamming graph
0
is uncountable; in particular, there is no E -transversal.

Note that the collapse does change some chromatic numbers to their lowest
possible value; for example, it forces the chromatic number of H to be equal
2
to two, by Proposition 11.1.6. The following example shows a somewhat more
dramatic case of this behavior, as the hypergraph in question does not have
Borel σ-bounded chromatic number. The example also shows that the use of
the fractional chromatic number in place of the usual chromatic number is to
some extent necessary in the assumption of the theorem.
Example 11.6.4. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
Let Q be the poset of all pairs q = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) of finite subsets of X such that
q q
(a ×b )∩E =0; the ordering is that of coordinatewise reverse inclusion. Let
q q
G be the graph connecting two conditions in Q if they are incompatible. Then
in ZF, |E|≤|2ω| if and only if the chromatic number of G is countable.
Note that the graph G does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number as
soon as the equivalence relation E is non-smooth as per Example 11.1.19. In
particular, there is a Borel graph which does not have Borel σ-bounded chro-

Proof. For the left-to-right direction, let h: X →2ω be a reduction of E to the
identity on 2ω. For every n ∈ ω and every set c ⊂ 2n let B = {q ∈ Q: ∀x ∈
c
a h(x) (cid:22) n ∈ c∧∀x ∈ b h(x) (cid:22) n ∈/ c}. Since the function h is E-invariant,
q q
the sets B ⊂Q are G-anticliques. Now, if q ∈Q is a condition, there is n∈ω
c
such that for all x ∈ a and x ∈ b , h(x ) (cid:22) n (cid:54)= h(x ) (cid:22) n. Thus, writing
0 q 1 q 0 1
c = {h(x) (cid:22) n: x ∈ a }, we conclude that q ∈ B . It follows that Q = (cid:83) B is
q c c c
a cover of Q by countably many G-anticliques.

For each n ∈ ω, let A = [ (cid:83) a ] and let h: X → 2ω be the function de-

fined by h(x)(n) = 0 if x ∈ A . We claim that this is a reduction of E to
n
the identity on 2ω, thus inducing the desired inequality |E| < |2ω|. To see
this, let x ,x ∈ X be arbitrary points. If x E x holds then h(x ) = h(x )
