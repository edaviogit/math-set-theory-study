m 14.6.5. Let P be the poset of infinite subsets of ω ordered by inclu-
sion. IntheP-extensionofthesymmetricSolovaymodel, thecomplementgraph
associated with the summable ideal on ω cannot be oriented.

14.6. THE RAMSEY ULTRAFILTER EXTENSION 357
Proof. Write I for the summable ideal on ω; i.e. I consists of sets a ⊂ ω such
that the sum Σ{ 1 : n ∈ a} is finite. Towards a contradiction, let κ be an
n+1
inaccessible cardinal, let W be a symmetric Solovay model derived from κ, let
p∈P beaconditionandτ beaP-namesuchthatp(cid:13)τ isanorientationofthe
complement graph associated with I. Both p,τ must be definable from some
real parameter z ∈ 2ω and some ground model parameters. Let V[K] be an
intermediate extension of the ground model by a poset of size < κ containing
the parameter z, and work in the model V[K].
We will produce a poset Q and a Q-name x˙ for an element of 2ω such
gen
that
(I) below every condition q ∈ Q there are conditions q ,q ≤ q and an au-
0 1
tomorphism π: Q (cid:22) q → Q (cid:22) q such that π(x˙ ) is forced by q to be
0 1 gen 1
equal to 1−x˙ modulo I;
gen
(II) the ultrafilter added by P still generates an ultrafilter in the P × Q-
extension.
Oncethisisdone, letG⊂P andH ⊂Qbemutuallygenericfiltersoverthe
model V[K], with p∈G, and work in V[K][G][H]. Let x=x˙ /H. Let U be
gen
the ultrafilter on ω generated by the filter G; this is possible by the item (II)
above. By Theorem 7.1.2, U is a balanced virtual condition in the poset P in
the model V[K][G][H]. The following is proved by a standard argument using
the balance of U:
Claim 14.6.6. In the model V[K][G][H], either Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) U (cid:13) (cid:104)x,1−

The remainder of the proof consists of the construction of the poset Q sat-
isfying (I) and (II). This is a pure ZFC construction in which the concentration
of measure phenomenon is a critical ingredient. Let (cid:104)J : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a very
n
fast sequence of successive intervals on ω. The following is the concentration of
measure type of demand on the intervals in question that we need. Let µ be
n
the normalized counting measure on 2Jn. Let d
n
be the metric on 2Jn defined
by d (x,y)=Σ{ 1 : x(m)(cid:54)=y(m)}. We demand that the following holds for
n m+1
every n∈ω:
(III) for every set a⊂2Jn of µ
n
-mass 1/n, the 2−n-neigborhood of a in 2Jn in
the sense of the metric d has µ -mass greater than 1/2.
