Toperformtherecursion,foralimitordinalαletC = C . Nowsuppose
α β∈α β
that the set C has been constructed and work to find C . Let M be a
α α+1
countable elementary submodel of a large structure containing C . If there is
α
no b∈B such that (C ∩M)∪b is a K-set, then let C =C and proceed
α α α+1 α
to the next ordinal. If, on the other hand, there is a set b ∈ B such that
α
(C ∩M)∪b is a K-set, we will work to produce a set a∈B such that C ∪a
α α α
is a K-set. Setting C =C ∪a will complete the recursion step in this case

as well.
Use Proposition 1.7.10 to find a perfect collection {H : z ∈2ω} of filters on
z
Coll(ω,<κ) pairwise mutually generic over the model M. The product forcing
theorem guarantees that for distinct points z ,z ∈2ω, M[H ]∩M[H ]=M.

Since the set C has size smaller than continuum, a counting argument shows
α
that there is a point z ∈2ω such that C ∩M[H ] and f(C )∩M[H ] are both
α z α z
subsets of M. Note that b∩M, f(b)∩M, and X ∩M are all sets in M[H ]

and use a Mostowski absoluteness argument for the model M[H ] to find a set

a∈B inthemodelM[H ]suchthata∩M =b∩M andf(a)∩M =f(b)∩M.

We claim that C ∪a is a K-set as desired.

To see this, suppose that d⊂C is a finite set. Adding some points of C ∩M

Thelattersetisequaltof(d∩M∩b)since(d∩M)∪b∈K bytheinitialchoice
of b and the fact that f is a modular function. Finally, d∩M∩b=d∩a by the
choice of the point z again, and so f(d)∩f(a)=f(d∩a) and a∪d∈K by the
modularity of the function f.

Once the recursion has been performed, let A = C and use the second

item of the recursion demands to conclude that A ⊂ X is a strongly maximal
K-set extending C.

The final class of simplicial complexes investigated in this section deals with
complexes associated with pre-geometries of a form particularly simple from
the descriptive set theoretic view.

from the hyperspace K(X) ofcompact subsetsof X with the Vietoris topology.

1. If A⊂X is a maximal K-set, then the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,A),Aˇ(cid:105) is balanced in
the poset P;

3. distinct maximal K-sets yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
