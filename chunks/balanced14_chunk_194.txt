n and the statement of the proposition follows.
Corollary 9.1.5. LetE beaBorelequivalencerelationonaPolishspaceX. In
cofinally balanced extensions of a symmetric Solovay model, |E+|(cid:54)≤|E| holds.

9.1. THE WELL-ORDERED DIVIDE 203
Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that |E+| ≤ |E| holds in the exten-
sion. The Proposition yields |HC| ≤ |E|. Clearly, ℵ ≤ |HC| holds in ZF,
1
and the concatenation of the cardinal inequalities contradicts the conclusion of
Corollary 9.1.3.
If one wishes to add well-ordered sequences of some objects in the Solovay
model and maintain control, it is possible to use weakly balanced forcing. The
following theorem, stated in terms of Convention 1.7.16, shows that there will
be no uncountable sequences of reals in the resulting extension.
Theorem 9.1.6. InweaklybalancedextensionsofthesymmetricSolovaymodel
W, every set of ordinals belongs to W.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset such that P
is weakly balanced below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model derived
from κ and work in the model W. Let p ∈ P be a partial order and let τ be a
P-name for a set of ordinals; we have to find a strengthening of the condition p
which decides the membership of every ordinal in the set τ. To this end, note
that both p,τ are definable from a parameter z ∈ 2ω and some parameters in
the ground model.
Let V[K] be an intermediate generic extension obtained by a poset of size
< κ such that z ∈ V[K]. Working in the model V[K], let p¯ be a weakly
balanced virtual condition in the poset P, below the condition P. We claim
that for every ordinal α, it is the case that Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p¯ decides in P the
membershipoftheordinalαˇ inthesetτ. Supposetowardsacontradictionthat

As the last remark in this section, many preservation theorems in this book
can be combined since the various properties of the posets concerned are pre-
served under product. In view of the many mutual consistency results concern-
