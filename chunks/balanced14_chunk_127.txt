Definition 6.1.3. Let K be a Borel simplicial complex on a Polish space X.
1. A K-walk is a finite sequence (cid:104)a : i ∈ j(cid:105) of elements of K such that for

every k ∈j\{0} there is a set b⊂ a such that (cid:104)a ,b(cid:105)∈Γ ;

2. A K-walk (cid:104)a : i ∈ j(cid:105) is said to start at a point x ∈ X if a = {x } and

Proposition 6.1.4. Let K be a Borel simplicial complex on a Polish space X.
E is an analytic equivalence relation. It is the smallest equivalence relation E
K
on X such that for every finite set a⊂X, a∈K if and only if for every E-class
c, a∩c∈K.
Proof. Write Γ = Γ and E = E . It is immediate that the relation E is an
K K
equivalence. The complexity assertion is also immediate from the definitions.
For the optimality assertion, for an equivalence relation F on X write φ(F)
for the statement that for every finite set a ⊂ X, a ∈ K if and only if for
every F-class c, a∩c ∈ K. We first need to verify that φ(E) holds. Suppose

x. Produce a K-walk from x which reaches all the finitely many points in c∩a.
The walk can be extended by the set a\c, reaching an arbitrary element of a.
This means that all points of a belong to the same E-class, a contradiction.
Now suppose that F be an equivalence relation on X for which φ(F) holds;
we must argue that E ⊆ F. Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails
and let x ,x ∈X be E-related points which are not F-related. Let (cid:104)a : i∈j(cid:105)
0 1 i
be a K-walk starting from x and reaching x . Let k ∈ j be the smallest
