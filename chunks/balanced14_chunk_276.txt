Let M be the R-name for the model obtained from the first α many iterands.

Consider the R-name σ for a function from E-classes to 2ω such that if c is an

R forces σ to be an injection of the set of E-classes to 2ω. By Theorem 6.6.3,
σ represents a balanced condition in the collapse poset P, and it is not hard to
see that this balanced condition is below p.
Finally,wearereadyforthemainbodyoftheproof. Letκbeaninaccessible
cardinal, let W be a Solovay model derived from κ, and work in W. Suppose
that p ∈ P is a condition and τ is a P-name such that p (cid:13) τ: Y → ω is a
F
function. We must find a condition p¯≤ p, a number n ∈ ω, and a hyperedge
e ∈ G such that for all y ∈ e, p¯(cid:13) τ(yˇ) = mˇ. The condition p ∈ P and the
E
name τ are definable from parameters in the ground model and a parameter
z ∈2ω. Let V[K] be an intermediate extension obtained by a poset of size <κ
which contains the parameter z and work in the model V[K].
