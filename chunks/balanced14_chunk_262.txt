nt; we have to show that a ∩c = a ∩c holds. Let O ∈ b be an open

set such that x ∈ O, and use the second property of a descriptor to see that
a ∩c=a ∩c={γ·x: γ ∈f(O)}. The theorem follows.

11.4. LOCALLY COUNTABLE SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES 275

finite graph on a Polish space X, if the chromatic number of G is ≤ n, then
there is a meager set B ⊂X and a decomposition of the set X \B into 2n−1
many Borel G-anticliques. We have:
Example 11.4.7. Let G be a Borel locally finite graph on a Polish space X
of chromatic number n. Let K be the simplicial complex of all finite partial G
colorings with ≤ 2n−1 colors which can be extended to a total coloring with
≤ 2n−1 many colors in which at most n many colors are attained infinitely
many times. Then K is a Borel locally countable simplicial complex which is
Suslin σ-centered.
Proof. NotethatK isinfactasimplicialcomplexonX×(2n−1). Thevarious
assertionsoftheexamplefollowfromtwosimplegeneralgraphtheoreticclaims.
Let H be a locally finite graph on a set V of vertices and let c: V → m be
a H-coloring with finitely many colors. Define F(c) = {i ∈ m: the set {v ∈
V : c(v)=i} is finite}.
Claim 11.4.8. For every finite set a ⊂ V and every set e ⊂ m of size |F(c)|
there is a H-coloring d: V →m such that c(cid:22)a=d(cid:22)a and F(d)=e.
Proof. It will be enough, given i ∈ F(c) and j ∈ m\F(c), to find a coloring
d: V → m such that c (cid:22) a = d (cid:22) a and F(d) = (F(c)∪{j})\{i}. To this end,
let b = a∪{v ∈ V : c(v) = i}∪{u ∈ V : ∃v {u,v} ∈ H and c(v) = i}. Let d
be the coloring equal to c except on the vertices v ∈ V \b such that c(v) = j,
which will have d(v)=i. It is easy to verify that d works.
Claim 11.4.9. For every finite set a ⊂ V there is a finite partial H-coloring
d: V → m such that a ⊂ dom(d), c (cid:22) a = d (cid:22) a, and for every edge {u,v} ∈ H
with u∈dom(d) and v ∈/ dom(d), d(u)∈/ |F(c)|+1 holds.
Proof. By the previous claim, we can adjust c so that F(c) is the set of the
first F(c)-many natural numbers. Let a(cid:48) be the union of the finite sets a,
{v ∈ V : c(v) ∈ F(c)}, and {v ∈ V : ∃u {u,v} ∈ H and c(u) ∈ F(c)}. Let b be
theunionofthefinitesetsa(cid:48)and{v ∈V : ∃u∈a(cid:48){u,v}∈H andc(u)=|F(c)|}.
Let d=c(cid:22)b and observe that d works.
Now, we are ready to complete the proof of the example. Write E for the Borel
equivalence relation of G-path connectedness on the space X. First of all, the
simplicial complex K is Borel and locally countable. Applying the last claim
to each connected component of the graph G, it is clear that a finite partial
G-coloring a belongs to K just in case for every E-class c ⊂ X there is a finite
partial G-coloring d such that dom(a)∩c ⊂ dom(d) ⊂ c and for every G-edge
{x,y} with x ∈ dom(d) and y ∈ c\dom(d) it is the case that d(u) ∈/ n holds.
(Such a coloring d can be completed by coloring the rest of the class c with the
first n many colors, which is possible by the chromatic number assumption on
G.) This is a Borel condition.
