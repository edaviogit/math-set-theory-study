absoluteness.

9.2. THE SMOOTH DIVIDE 211
Corollary 9.2.21. Let Γ,∆ be Polish abelian groups, with Γ uncountable and
torsion free, and ∆ divisible and compact.
1. In the P(Γ,∆) extension of the symmetric Solovay model, |E |>|2ω|;

2. ItisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is a discontinuous homomorphism from Γ to ∆, and yet |E |>|2ω|.
0
Proof. RecalfromExample8.2.3thatthegenerichomomorphismaddedbythe
poset P(Γ,∆) is discontinuous. Other than that, the corollary follows from
Theorem 9.2.2.
The assumption that ∆ be compact cannot be dropped entirely from the state-
ment of the corollary by the following ZF observation:
Proposition 9.2.22. (ZF+DC) Let Y be a separable Banach space. If there is
a discontinuous homomorphism h: Y → Y then there is an E -transversal, in
0
particular |E |≤|2ω|.
0
Proof. The discontinuity of the homomorphism and the DC assumption yield
a sequence (cid:104)y : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of elements of Y such that |y | > Σ |y | and
n n m>n m
|h(y ) > 2|h(y )|. Now, for every x ∈ 2ω let g(x) = Σ{y : x(n) = 1} ∈ Y.

Example9.2.23. TheKurepaposetP onaPolishspaceX ofDefinition8.4.2is
compactlybalanced. Toseethis,equip2X,identifiedwithP(X),withtheusual
product topology, refer to Theorem 8.4.3 to argue that the balanced conditions
are classified by subsets of P(X) closed under intersections and containing X,
and observe, that sets of this type form a closed and therefore compact subset
of P(X). The properties (1-3) of Definition 9.2.1 are easily verified for this
topology.

As a final remark in this section, the consistency results obtained here can be
combinedusingthecountablesupportproduct. Thebalancedvirtualconditions
in a countable product of posets are simply sequences of balanced virtual con-
ditions in each coordinate (Theorem 5.2.9). A product of Hausdorff compact
