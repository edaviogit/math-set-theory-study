its pinned status is absolute among all generic extensions.
Theorem 2.7.1. Suppose that E is a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. The following are equivalent:

2.7. ABSOLUTENESS 69
1. E is pinned;
2. Foreveryω-modelM ofZFCcontainingthecodeforE,M |=E ispinned.
Proof. For simplicity assume X = ωω. The implication (2)→(1) is trivial. If
(1) fails, then E is not pinned, and the failure of (2) is witnessed by M =V.
The implication (1)→(2) is more difficult. We start with an abstract claim
which can be used in several other absoluteness results, and which appears in
several less efficient versions in existing literature. Say that an ω-model N
of ZFC is correct about stationary sets if for all sets a,b ∈ N, if N |= a is
uncountable then in fact a is uncountable, and if N |=b⊂[a]ℵ0 is a stationary
system of countable sets, then in fact b is a stationary system of countable sets.
Note that as N is an ω-model, for any set c, if N |=c is countable then in fact
c is countable.
Claim 2.7.2. [5, Theorem 1.12], [51, Section 4] Let M be a countable ω-model
of a large fragment of ZFC. Then there is an elementary embedding j: M →N
such that N is an ω-model correct about stationary sets.
Proof. We start with setting up a bookkeeping tool. By a classical result of
Solovay, ω can be decomposed into ℵ many stationary sets. Thus, there is
1 1
a surjective function f: ω → ω × ω such that preimages of singletons are
1 1
stationary.
Now, by recursion on α ∈ ω build countable ω-models M of ZFC and
1 α
maps j : M → M for all β ∈ α. With each model M we also pick a
βα β α α
surjection π : ω →M arbitrarily. The following are the recursive demands on
α α
the construction:
• M = M and (cid:104)j : M → M : γ ∈ β ∈ α(cid:105) is a commuting system of
0 γβ γ β
elementary embeddings;
• if α ∈ ω is limit then M is the direct limit of the previous models and
1 α
embeddings;
• whenever α ∈ ω is an ordinal such that f(α) = (cid:104)β,n(cid:105) and β ∈ α and
1
(cid:83)
M |=b=π (n) is astationary system of countable sets on a= b, then
β β
writing c = j(cid:48)(cid:48) j (a) we get that M contains c and M |= c ∈
αα+1 βα α+1 α+1
j (b).

It is only necessary to show how the last item is arranged. Thus, suppose that
its assumptions are satisfied at α ∈ ω . Work in the model M and consider

M is countable, there is a filter G ⊂ P generic over the model M . Let
α α
j : M → M be its associated generic ultrapower as in [45, Lemmas
αα+1 α α+1
22.13 and 14]. Then M will be again an ω-model. Note that the set c
α+1
belongs to the model M as it is represented by the identity function; it also
α+1
has the requested properties by the L(cid:32) o´s theorem.
In the end, let j: M → N be the direct limit of the system of elementary
