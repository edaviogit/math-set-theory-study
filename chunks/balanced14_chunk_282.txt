11.7. COMPACTLY BALANCED POSETS 295
Proof. For the first item, use Corollary 11.4.20. For the second item, use Ex-
ample 11.1.20 to show that the hypergraph G does not have Borel σ-bounded
chromatic number; it is clearly actionable. Then, use Theorem 11.7.2 to the
poset P adding a G -coloring with two colors by countable approximations
0
whose domain is E -invariant. It is not difficult to see and follows from Theo-

with two colors, which naturally form a closed subset of the compact Hausdorff
space 22ω. Thus the poset P is compactly balanced.
Corollary 11.7.8. 1. Let P be the poset of infinite subsets of ω ordered by
inclusion. In the P-extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number
of H is uncountable.
<ω
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that there is a nonprin-
cipal ultrafilter on ω and the chromatic number of H is uncountable.
<ω
This is immediate from the fact that the poset P is compactly balanced–
Example 9.2.4. The corollary can be viewed as a commentary on a result of
Rosendal [76]: in ZF+DC, if there is a discontinuous homomorphism between
Polish groups then the chromatic numbers of the Hamming graphs H are fi-
n
nite. Sinceanonprincipalultrafilteronω yieldsadiscontinuoushomomorphism
from the Cantor group 2ω to 2, this result cannot be extended to the diagonal
Hamming graph.
The following two corollaries use compactly balanced posets from Exam-
ples 9.2.11 and 9.2.13.
Corollary 11.7.9. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
1. Let P be the linearization poset for the E-quotient space as in Exam-
ple 8.6.5. In the P-extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number
of H is uncountable.
<ω
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that there is a linear
ordering on the E-quotient space and the chromatic number of H is
<ω
uncountable.
Corollary 11.7.10. Let G be a locally finite Borel graph on a Polish space X
satisfying the Hall condition.
1. Let P be the poset adding a perfect matching for G as in Example 6.2.4.
In the P-extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of H is
<ω
uncountable.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that G has a perfect
matching and the chromatic number of H is uncountable.
<ω
The following example presents a (necessarily) non-invariant hypergraph which
does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number, yet it has countable chro-
matic number in some compactly balanced extension of the Solovay model.
