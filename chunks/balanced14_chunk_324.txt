lation on a Polish space X.
1. Let P be the E-linearization poset as in Example 8.6.5. In the P-generic
extension of the symmetric Solovay model every homomorphism between
Polish groups is continuous;

13.3. EXAMPLES 341
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
the E-quotient space carries a linear ordering and every homomorphism
between Polish groups is continuous.
Example 13.3.16. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ.
Let P be the 3-Hamel decomposition poset of Definition 8.1.11. The poset P is
4,3-balanced.
Theorem 13.2.4 shows that the poset is not 3,2-balanced as soon as the field Φ
has characteristic distinct from 2.
Proof. By Theorem 8.1.12, balanced virtual conditions are classified by color-
ings c: X →ω such that any monochromatic triple of pairwise distinct nonzero
elements of X is linearly independent. For each such coloring c, the pair
Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105) is balanced. We will show that the pair is in fact 4,3-balanced.
Suppose that in some ambient generic extension, V[G ] for i∈4 are generic

extensionsandanythreeofthemaremutuallygeneric. Supposethatp ∈V[G ]
i i
for i∈4 are conditions below c; we must show that they have a common lower
bound. Write d = dom(p ) for i ∈ 4. Let d ⊂ X be a countable subspace
i i
(cid:83) (cid:83)
containing d as a subset and let a = d\ d . For each point x ∈ a and
i i i i
distinct indexes i,j ∈ 4 let e (x) = {y ∈ d : ∃z ∈ d : x,y,z are linearly
ij i j
dependent} and as in Claim 8.1.14 argue that each the set e (x), if nonempty,
ij
is a union of Φ-shifts of a single X∩V-coset distinct from V.
Now, let J be the Borel ideal on ω used in the definition of P as in Defini-
tion 8.1.11. Let b∈J be a set which cannot be covered by finitely many sets of
the form p(cid:48)(cid:48)e and a finite set. Let b= (cid:83) {b : x∈a} be a partition of the set b
i ij x
(cid:83)
into sets with the same property. Let q: d→ω be any map such that p ⊂q
i i
and for each x∈a, q(x)∈b \ (cid:83) p(cid:48)(cid:48)e (x). Note that the latter union consists
x ij i ij
of sets in the ideal J and so the set b \ (cid:83) p(cid:48)(cid:48)e (x) is nonempty. We claim
x ij i ij
that q is a common lower bound of the conditions p for i∈4.
i
We will only show that any triple {x ,x ,x } of pairwise distinct nonzero
0 1 2
linearly dependent points is not monochromatic. There are several cases to
consider. If two points of the triple belong to one and the same set d then
i
so does the third one, then we use the assumption that p ∈ P is a coloring
i
withoutsuchmonochromatictriples. Thecaseinwhicheachpointonthetriple
belongs to some d but never to the same one, say x ∈d \V, x ∈d \V, and
i 0 0 1 1
x ∈ d \V is impossible in view of the assumption that the three extensions

V[G ],V[G ],V[G ] are mutually generic. If one of the points, say x belongs
0 1 2 0
to a and the other two do not, say x ∈ d and x ∈ d for i,j ∈ 4 distinct,
1 i 2 j
thenq(x )isdistinctfromallcolorsinthesetp(cid:48)(cid:48)e (x )andsoisdifferentfrom

p (x ), andmonochromaticityfailsagain. Finally, ifmorethanonepointofthe

triple is in the set a, then the triple cannot be monochromatic since the map
q (cid:22)a is an injection.
Corollary 13.3.17. Let X be a Borel vector space over a countable field Φ.
