p ∈ V[H ], p ∈ V[H ] are incompatible conditions. Expanding the models

sume that for every point x ∈ X ∩V, either x ∈ p or p ∪{x} is not a K-set,

with say a point x ∈ q¯ \q , then let A = {q ∈ P: x ∈ q} and A = {q ∈

and their suprema ΣA and ΣA are incompatible in P, and p ≤ Σp(cid:48) and

p ≤ Σp(cid:48). Suppose then that q = q , denote the common value p¯ and use

the product forcing theorem to show that p¯ ∈ V holds. Suppose first that p¯
is not a maximal K-set. Then there must be x ∈ X \ p¯ such that p¯∪ {x}
is a K-set and inclusion-minimal finite sets a ⊂ p and a ⊂ p such that
