Suppose that E is an equivalence relation on a Polish space Z, coded in each
model M(y). Suppose that τ: Y → ω is a Borel function such that for each
y ∈Y,M(y)|=τ(y)isaP(y)-nameofanelementofZ. Supposethatz: Y →Z
is a Borel function. Can we find a Borel function G: Y → P(ω) such that for
eachy ∈Y,G(y)isafilteronP(y)genericoverM(y),suchthatthevaluationof
τ(y)overG(y)isE-relatedtoz(y)? Tocometoausefulaffirmativeconclusion,
we assume that the models in the range of the function M are all well-founded,
and the equivalence relation E is induced as an orbit equivalence relation of a
continuous action of a Polish group Γ on the space Z. In such circumstances,
we have the following:
Proposition 2.8.5. Given E,M,P,τ as above:
1. the set B = {y ∈ Y: there is a filter G ⊂ P(y) generic over the model
M(y) such that τ(y)/G is E-related to z(y)} is Borel;
2. there is a Borel function G: B →P(ω) such that for every y ∈B, G(y)⊂
P(y) is a filter generic over M(y) such that τ(y)/G(y) is E-related to
z(y).
Proof. Let P be the poset of all nonempty open subsets of Γ ordered by in-
Γ
clusion, with its name γ˙ for a generic element of Γ. Use Proposition 2.8.1 to
find Borel functions Q,σ: Y →ω so that for every y ∈Y, M(y)|=Q(y) is the
complete subalgebra of the complete Boolean algebra of P(y)×P generated
Γ
by the name σ(y)=γ˙ ·τ(y).
LetD ={(cid:104)y,δ,G(cid:105)∈Y×Γ×P(ω): G⊂Q(y)isafiltergenericoverthemodel
M(y) such that ν(y)/G = δ ·z(y)}. This is a Borel set by Proposition 2.8.1.
The projection of D into the Y coordinate is the set B.
Claim 2.8.6. For each pair (cid:104)y,δ(cid:105) ∈ Y ×Γ, the vertical section D is either
yδ
empty or a singleton.
Proof. ThisusesthewellfoundednessofthemodelM(y). Supposethatthesec-
