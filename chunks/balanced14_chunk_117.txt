However, certain type of virtual conditions is entirely central to the technology
developed in this book, and normally allows a neat classification by natural
combinatorial objects. These are the balanced virtual conditions of the next
section.
5.2 Balanced conditions
This section isolates the notion of a balanced condition in a given Suslin poset
and a natural equivalence of balanced conditions. It turns out that every bal-
anced class is represented by a virtual condition.
Definition 5.2.1. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Let Q be a poset and τ a
Q-name for an analytic subset of P. We say that (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair in P
if for all posets R ,R and all R ×Q- and R ×Q- names σ , σ for elements

of P such that R ×Q (cid:13) σ ≤ Στ and R ×Q (cid:13) σ ≤ Στ, it is the case that
0 0 1 1
(R ×Q)×(R ×Q)(cid:13)σ ,σ are compatible conditions in the poset P.
0 1 0 1
Note that the definition of a balanced pair depends on the Suslin poset P. The
Suslin poset is not mentioned as it will be always understood from the context
and no opportunity for confusion arises. The expressions of the type σ ≤ Στ
(meaning that every condition extending σ is compatible with a condition in τ)
will be shortened to σ ≤τ below as there can be no confusion. Balanced pairs

The following proposition restates the notion of a balanced pair in terms of the
generic extension as opposed to the forcing relation.
Proposition 5.2.2. Let (cid:104)P,≤(cid:105) be a Suslin forcing. Let Q be a poset and τ a
Q-name for an analytic subset of P. The following are equivalent:
1. (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair;
2. whenever V[H ] and V[H ] are mutually generic extensions, G ,G ⊂ Q
