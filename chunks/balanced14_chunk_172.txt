argument, for each element b ∈ B there must be an element π(b) ∈ B such
that Q (cid:13) χ(ˇb) = π(b). It is immediate that π is an automorphism of B and
Q(cid:13)(cid:104)C,χ(cid:105)≤(cid:104)BV,πˇ(cid:105). Item (2) then follows from (1) and Proposition 5.2.4.
Finally, item (3) is obvious. For the last sentence, apply (1) with Fact 8.3.2.
8.4 Kurepa families
The notion of a Kurepa family on a set is an old one [61]; it appears intermit-
tently in modern set theory [94], [24, Section 7]. In this section, we show how
to force a cofinal Kurepa family on a Polish space with a balanced poset.
Definition 8.4.1. Let X be a set.
1. A Kurepa family is a set A ⊂ [X]ℵ0 such that for every countable set
b⊂X, the set {a∩b: a∈A} is countable;
2. the family is cofinal if for every countable set b ⊂ X there is a set a ∈ A
such that b⊂a.

Polish space can be added by balanced forcing.
Definition 8.4.2. LetX beanuncountablePolishspace. TheKurepa poset P
is a poset of all countable sets p⊂[X]ℵ0 closed under finite intersections. The
ordering is defined by q ≤p if p⊂q and for every a∈q and b∈p, a∩b∈p.
Clearly the poset P does not depend on the choice of the uncountable Polish
space X up to isomorphism. Clearly, P is a σ-closed Suslin forcing. If G⊂P is
(cid:83)
a generic filter, then a simple genericity argument shows that G is a cofinal
Kurepa family on X which is closed under finite intersections. For every set
A ⊂ P(X) closed under finite intersections note that Aˇ is a Coll(ω,P(X))-
name for an element of the Kurepa poset. It turns out that if X ∈ A then the
pair(cid:104)Coll(ω,P(ω)),Aˇ)(cid:105)isbalanced,andallbalancedpairsareuptoequivalence
of this form. This is the content of the following theorem.
Theorem 8.4.3. LetX beanuncountablePolishspaceandletP betheKurepa
poset on X.
1. if A ⊂ P(X) is a set containing X and closed under finite intersections,
then the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(X)),Aˇ(cid:105) is balanced;
2. if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is a balanced pair for P then there is a set A ⊂ P(X) closed
under finite intersections and containing X such that the balanced pairs
(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,P(X)),Aˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;
3. distinct sets as in (1) yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
