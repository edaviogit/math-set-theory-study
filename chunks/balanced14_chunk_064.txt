Much more complicated effects can be realized if the hypergraph G is allowed
to have infinite edges. We conclude this section with an example of this type.

Theorem 2.5.40. There is a combinatorially universal Borel equivalence rela-
tion with countably many classes on X2 for every Polish space X.

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume X = P(ω). Let ω = a
n,m∈ω n,m
be a partition of ω into infinite sets. For almost disjoint sets b,c ⊂ ω such
that b is lexicographically less than c define f(b,c) = n and f(c,b) = m if
max(b∩c) ∈ a , in other cases define f(b,c) = 0. Let R be the equivalence
n,m
relation induced by the function f. We will show that R is combinatorially
universal.
Fix a cardinal κ and a function g: κ2 → ω which induces an equivalence
relation T with countably many classes. Define the poset P as the collection of
all functions p such that
• dom(p)⊂κ is a finite set;
• rng(p)consistsoffinitesubsetsofω suchthatneitherofthemisaninitial
segment of another;
• for every α(cid:54)=β such that p(α) is lexicographically smaller than p(β), the
set p(α)∩p(β) is nonempty, and its maximum belongs to the set a
m,n
where g(α,β)=m and g(β,α)=n.

Claim 2.5.41. The poset P is c.c.c.
