that ZF+DC holds, the orbit divide is preserved, and there is a decomposition
of R2 into countably many pieces neither of which contains the vertices of an
equilateral triangle.

9.4. THE ORBIT DIVIDE 227
Now it is time to show that the existence of certain combinatorial objects
implies that the orbit divide breaks. In the following theorem and corollaries,
we neglect the real parameter necessary to define the Polish spaces in question.
For the rest of the section, put X =(2ω)ω.
Theorem 9.4.28. (ZF)SupposethatthereisaPolishspaceY andasetA⊂Y
such that the preordering ≤ on X, defined by x ≤ x if x ∈ L[x ,A], is well-
1 0 1 0
founded. Then there is a countable complete section for E .

Proof. For each point x ∈ X and each number m ∈ ω, write x\m for the
element of X defined by (x\m)(n) = x(n) if n ≥ m, and (x\m)(n) =the
infinite sequence of zeroes if m < n. For each number m ∈ ω write M (x)
m
for the model L[x\m,A]. By the well-foundedness assumption, there must be
n ∈ ω such that for all m ≥ n the models M (x) are the same. Note that if
m
x ,x ∈ X are E -related points, the stable value of the models M (x ) and
0 1 1 m 0
M (x ) is the same. We would like to define the complete section D ⊂ X
m 1
(cid:84)
by setting x ∈ D if x belongs to M (x). The stabilization feature shows
m m
that D has nonempty intersection with each E -class. However, a more precise
1
definition of the complete section is necessary to make the conclusion that the
intersection with each E -class is countable.

ObservefirstthatbyastandardcondensationargumentthemodelM (x)is

a model of ZFC+CH, and its constructibility ordering orders its elements of X
in ordertype ωMm(x). For natural numbers n≤m∈ω define ρ (x) to be the

indexofx\nintheconstructibilitywell-orderingofM (x)ifx\n∈M (x),and
m m
let ρ (x) = 0 otherwise. Let α(x) = limsup sup ρ (x). The definition
nm n m≥n nm
of the ordinal α(x) does not depend on the choice of x within its equivalence
class by the stabilization assumption. Also, α(x) is a countable ordinal. To see
this,workinthemodelM (x)andevaluatetheordinalα(x)there. SinceM (x)

is a model of choice, its ω is regular and so α(x)∈ωM0(x). Since ωM0(x) ≤ω ,

the countability of α(x) follows.
Finally, let C = {x ∈ X: ∃n x = x\n and for all m ≥ n, x\n ∈ M (x)
m
and ρ (x)≤α(x)}. To see that the set C meets every E class in a nonempty
nm 1
countable set, let z ∈X be arbitrary. The definition of the ordinal α(z) shows
that there is a number n ∈ ω such that for all m ≥ n, z \n ∈ M (z) and is
m
enumerated before α(z) there; clearly, letting x = z \n we get x ∈ C ∩[z]E .

Also, note that C ∩[z]E

⊂ {x ∈ X: ∃n x ∈ M
n
(z) and the index of x in the
constructibility well-ordering of M (z) is ≤ α(z)} and observe that the latter

set is countable as the ordinal α(z) is countable.
Corollary 9.4.29. (ZF) Let Y be an uncountable Polish space. If there is an
acyclic decomposition of [Y]2 then E has a countable complete section.

Proof. Let c: [Y]2 →ω be the acyclic decomposition. Fix a countable basis for
