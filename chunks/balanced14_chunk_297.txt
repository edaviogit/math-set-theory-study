Let K be a G matroid on a Polish space X and P be
δ
the poset of countable K-sets as in Definition 6.5.1. The poset P is Bernstein
balanced and every balanced virtual condition is Bernstein balanced.

Proof. ThebalancedvirtualconditionsareclassifiedbymaximalK-setsbyThe-
orem 6.5.2. We must prove that every such a maximal set A⊂X represents a
Bernstein balanced condition.
To this end, let V[G] be a generic extension and work in V[G]. Towards
contradiction, suppose that there is a condition p∈P such that A⊂p, an infi-
nite poset Q∈V such that P(Q)∩V is countable in V[G], and an uncountable
family H consisting of filters on Q which are mutually generic over V such that
for each H ∈H there is a condition p ∈P ∩V[H] such that A⊂p and p

is incompatible with p. An examination of the incompatibility options and a

Let |b|=n. Let d⊂G be a set of size greater than n. Let c⊂A be a finite
set such that for every filter H ∈ d, b∪c∪a ∈/ K holds. Note that b∪c ∈ K

and (by a repeated application of the balance of the set A) a ∪c ∈ K.

Let e = b∪c∪ a and let |e| = m. Since a ∪c ⊂ e is a set in K
H∈d H H∈d H
of cardinality m−n, the exchange property of the matroid K guarantees that
every subset of e maximal with respect to membership in K has cardinality at
least m−n. Let f ⊂ e be a maximal set in K extending the set b∪c. Since
|f| ≥ m−n, there must be a filter H ∈ d such that a ⊂ f. This contradicts

the assumption that b∪c∪a ∈/ K.

Corollary 12.2.13. Let X be a Polish field and F ⊂X a countable subfield.
1. Let P be the poset of countable subsets of X which are algebraically inde-
pendent over F, with the reverse inclusion ordering. In the P-extension
of the symmetric Solovay model, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω
and OCA holds.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, X
has a transcendence basis over F, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω
and OCA holds.
Many quotient simplicial complex forcings are Bernstein balanced.
Example 12.2.14. Let F be a Fraiss´e class with strong amalgamation. Let
E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X. Then the E,F-Fraiss´e
forcing of Definition 8.6.3 is Berstein balanced and every balanced condition is
Bernstein balanced.

tually generic over V. By the mutual genericity, the only E-classes that occur
in more than one model V[H] for H ∈H are the classes which are realizations
of virtual E-classes in V. By a counting argument, there is a filter H ∈H such
