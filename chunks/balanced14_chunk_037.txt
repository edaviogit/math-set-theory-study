DuringtheinvestigationofthesymmetricSolovaymodel,thefollowingtechnical
fact and its corollary about the symmetric Solovay model will be used without
mention.

1.7. NOTATION AND TERMINOLOGY 33
Fact 1.7.14. [45,Section26] Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal and let W be the
symmetric Solovay extension of V associated with κ. Then
1. every set in W is definable from parameters in V ∪2ω;
2. in W, whenever M is a generic extension of V by a partial order of size
<κ then W is a symmetric Solovay extension of M.
Corollary 1.7.15. Suppose that κ is an inaccessible cardinal, X is a Polish
space, φ(x,(cid:126)y) is a formula of set theory with all free variables displayed, and p(cid:126)
is a sequence of sets of the same length as (cid:126)y. The following are equivalent:
1. Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)∃x∈X φ(x,p(cid:126));
2. there exist a poset R of size < κ and an R-name σ for an element of X
such that R(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)φ(σ,p(cid:126)).
Many models of set theory we investigate are extensions of the symmetric Solo-
vay model by a suitably definable, typically Suslin, forcing. Since the instru-
mentalpropertiesoftheSuslinforcinginquestionmaynotbeabsolutebetween
forcingextensions,weusethefollowingkeyconventiontoshortenthestatements
of the results we obtain.
Convention 1.7.16. Let ψ be a property of partial orders, and let φ be a
sentence in the language of set theory.
1. For a Suslin partial order P and an inaccessible cardinal κ, the statement
“P isψbelowκ”meansthatV |=ψ(P)holdsineveryforcingextension”.
κ
The statement “P is ψ cofinally below κ” means that V |=every forcing
κ
extension has a further extension in which ψ(P) holds”.
2. The phrase “In ψ extensions of the Solovay model, φ holds” denotes the
following long statement. Let P be a Suslin forcing and let κ be an
inaccessible cardinal such that P is φ below κ. Let W be a symmetric
Solovay model derived from κ. Let G ⊂ P be a filter generic over W.
Then W[G]|=φ holds.
3. The phrase “In cofinally ψ extensions of the Solovay model, φ holds”
denotes the following statement. Let P be a Suslin forcing. Let κ be an
inaccessible cardinal. Suppose that P is ψ cofinally below κ. Let W be a
symmetric Solovay model derived from κ. Let G ⊂ P be a filter generic
over W. Then W[G]|=φ holds.
In several cases, we will need the basics of the stationary tower forcing.
Definition 1.7.17. [64] Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. The symbol Q
κ
denotes the (countably based) stationary tower up to κ. That is, Q consists of
κ
sets S such that S ⊂[dom(S)]ℵ0 is stationary and dom(S)∈V
κ
. The ordering
is defined by T ≤ S if dom(S) ⊂ dom(T) and {x∩dom(S): x ∈ T} ⊂ S. If
G ⊂ Q is a generic filter, j: V → M denotes the generic ultrapower derived
κ
from G.

34 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Fact 1.7.18. [64] Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal, G⊂Q be a generic filter,
κ
and j: V →M be the generic embedding.
1. If κ is a Woodin cardinal in the ground model, then κ=ωV[G] and Mω ⊂
1
M in V[G]. In particular, M is well-founded.
2. If κ is a weakly compact Woodin cardinal in the ground model, then for
every z ∈2ω in V[G] there is a Woodin cardinal λ<κ such that G∩Q is
λ
genericoverV andz ∈V[G∩Q ]. Inparticular,themodelW =V(RV[G])
λ
is a symmetric Solovay extension of V derived from κ.
As a matter of notation, if the generic ultrapower model M is well-founded, it
is always identified with its transitive collapse.
