Finally, observe that the equivalence relation E (cid:22) B is obtained by an ap-
plication of the category quantifier to the Borel set {(cid:104)x,z,γ(cid:105)∈B×B×Γ: γ ∈
A (cid:105)}, so is Borel by [55, Theorem 16.1].

Theorem 2.8.9. Assume that there is a measurable cardinal. Let E be an
analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space X. The following are equivalent:
1. κ(E)=∞;
2. E ≤ E.

Proof. (2) implies (1) by Example 2.4.6 and Theorem 2.5.4. The large cardi-
nal assumption is not needed for this direction. For the (1)→(2) implication,
suppose that κ(E)=∞. Let κ be a measurable cardinal.
Claim 2.8.10. There exist a poset P of size κ and an E-pinned P-name τ such
that τ is not E¯-related to any name on a poset of size less than κ.
Proof. Since κ(E) = ∞, there exist a poset Q and an E-pinned Q-name σ
which is not E¯-equivalent to any name on a poset of size less than κ. Choose
an elementary submodel M of a large structure such that |M| = κ, V ⊂ M
κ
and Q,σ ∈ M. Let P = Q∩M and let τ = σ∩M. We claim that P,τ works
as required.
Indeed, if G×H ⊂ P ×P is a filter generic over V, then it is also generic
over M, by the elementarity of M and the forcing theorem in M M[G,H] |=
τ/GE τ/H,andbytheMostowskiabsolutenessbetweenM[G,H]andV[G,H],
V[G,H] |= τ/G E τ/H. This proves that the name τ is E-pinned. If R is a
poset in V of size < κ and ν is an E-pinned R-name and G×H ⊂ P ×R is a
generic filter over V, then R,ν ∈ M, the filter G×H also generic over M, by
the elementarity of M and the forcing theorem in M M[G,H]|=¬τ/GE ν/H,
and by the Mostowski absoluteness between M[G,H] and V[G,H], V[G,H]|=
¬τ/G E σ/H. This proves that ν E¯ τ fails and completes the proof of the
claim.
Choose a poset P on κ and an E-pinned name τ as in the claim. Choose a
large enough cardinal θ and skolemize the structure (cid:104)H ,∈,P,τ(cid:105) of sets whose
θ
transitive closures have cardinality less than θ. Let T be the theory of the
skolemized structure. Let j: V = M → M be an ultrapower embedding

associated with some normal measure on the measurable cardinal κ, and let
j : V →M beitsiterationsoflengthnforn≤ω. Theordinals{j (κ): n∈ω}

form a sequence of indiscernibles in the model j (H ). Let S be the theory of
ω θ
the indiscernibles in this structure. Let Y be the space of all linear orderings
on ω, and let Z be the space of all binary relations on ω. By Propositions 2.8.2
