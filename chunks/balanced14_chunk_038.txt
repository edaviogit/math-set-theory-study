olovay extension of V derived from κ.
As a matter of notation, if the generic ultrapower model M is well-founded, it
is always identified with its transitive collapse.

Chapter 2
The virtual realm
There are many quotient structures in mathematics. It turns out that a typical
quotient structure allows a useful canonical extension to its virtual version.
The purpose of this chapter is to lay the foundations of the theory of virtual
structures.
2.1 Virtual equivalence classes
The basis of any quotient structure of interest in the present book is a Polish
spaceX. Aquotientstructureworthitssaltwillalsouseanequivalencerelation

E-quotient space in a canonical way to a potentially much larger set or class.
Definition 2.1.1. [48, Definition 17.1.2] Let E be an analytic equivalence re-
lation on a Polish space X. Let P be a poset and τ a P-name for an element of
X.
1. The name τ is E-pinned if P ×P (cid:13)τ E τ ;

2. if τ is E-pinned, then the pair (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) will be called an E-pin.
The definition may puzzle a novice reader. Its meaning is best illustrated by
the following proposition. An E-pinned name is one which in all forcing exten-
sions points at the same E-class, even though that E-class may not have any
representative in the ground model.
Proposition 2.1.2. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. Let P be a poset and τ a P-name for an element of X. The following are
equivalent:
1. (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) is an E-pin;
