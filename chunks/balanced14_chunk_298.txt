ual genericity, the only E-classes that occur
in more than one model V[H] for H ∈H are the classes which are realizations
of virtual E-classes in V. By a counting argument, there is a filter H ∈H such

that in the model V[H] there are no E-classes represented in the domain of p
other than the classes which are realizations of virtual E-classes in V. Then p
is compatible with every condition in V[H] which is stronger than p¯.
Corollary 12.2.15. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
1. Let P be the poset of linear orders on countable subsets of the E-quotient
space, with the reverse inclusion ordering. In the P-extension of the sym-
metric Solovay model, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on ω and OCA
holds.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
E-quotient space is linearly ordered, there is no nonprincipal ultrafilter on
ω and OCA holds.
There are many posets which are neither Bernstein balanced nor perfectly bal-
anced. The examples below are built to violate specific preservation properties
of Bernstein balanced posets.

countable. Thus, in the P-extension of the Solovay model, OCA fails. In view
of Theorem 12.2.5, P is not Bernstein balanced.
Example 12.2.17. Let P be the Lusin poset of Definition 8.8.5. In the P-
extension of the symmetric Solovay model in which the conclusion of Theo-
rem 12.2.6 fails. In particular, the Lusin poset is not Bernstein balanced.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal, let W be a symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ, and move to the model W. Let p = (cid:104)a,b(cid:105) ∈ P be a condition

To this end, find a parameter z ∈ 2ω such that both p,τ are definable from
some parameters in the ground model and the parameter z. Let V[K] be an

Let p¯ ≤ p be a balanced virtual condition in P as in Theorem 8.8.6, so
a =a. Since τ is forced to be an uncountable set, there must be a poset R, an
p¯
R-name σ for a condition in P stronger than p¯, and an R-name η for a point in
a \a such that R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) η ∈ τ. Note that η is forced to be a
