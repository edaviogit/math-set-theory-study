function ξ : P → P by ξ (q) = ξ (q(k)) where k ∈ ω is such that for all

and ξ : P → P . It is a matter of trivial diagram chasing to show that the
ωn ω n
maps form a commuting system of projections from P to P and moreover
n ω
π ,ξ ∈ M . Thus, letting G = ξ−1G , one can conclude that G ⊂ P

is a filter generic over M and therefore over M . Also G ∈ M [G ]

since G can be reconstructed in M [G ] as G = ξ−1G . In conclusion,

G ∈ M [G ].

Finally, we have to prove that every element of the intersection M [G ]
n n n
belongs to M [G ]. This is where the diagonal distributivity of the original
ω ω
poset sequence is used. Suppose that τ ∈M is a P -name for a set of ordinals
0 0
(cid:84)
and p∈P is a condition forcing τ ∈ M [G ]; we must produce a condition
0 n n n
p(cid:48) ≤p and a P -name τ ∈M such that p(cid:48) (cid:13)τ =τ /G . Consider a strategy

This is possible by the assumption on the name τ. By the diagonalization
assumption, Player II has a counterplay with conditions q ≤ p such that
n n
there is a condition p(cid:48) ≤ p for which π (p) ≤ q for all n ∈ ω. Let τ be the
0n n ω
P (cid:22) π (p(cid:48))-name defined by q (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ just in case ξ (q) (cid:13) αˇ ∈ τ. The

name τ can be reconstructed in every model M by the definition q (cid:13)αˇ ∈τ

Now we are ready to construct the requisite well-orderings verifying the
choice-coherence of the models (cid:104)M [G ]: n ∈ ω(cid:105). Let λ be an ordinal larger
n n
than the ranks of all the posets P for n ∈ ω. Let ≤ be a coherent well-
n
ordering of V ∩M . We will now describe a coherent well-ordering ≤(cid:48) of sets
λ 0
of rank < λ in the model M [G ]. In this well-ordering, the sets in M [G ]
0 0 ω ω
come first, ordered by some well-ordering in the model M [G ]. The sets in

M representing them. The sets in M [G ]\M [G ] come next with a similar
0 1 1 2 2
well-order, and so on. The coherence of the resulting well-ordering ≤(cid:48) is due to
the fact that for each k ∈ ω, the sequence (cid:104)G : n ≥ k(cid:105) belongs to the model

M [G ].

(2) is much easier. Suppose that τ ∈ M is a P -name for an ω-sequence
0 0
of ordinals in the model M [G ] and p ∈ P is a condition; we must find a
ω ω 0
condition r ≤ p and an ω-sequence z ∈ M such that r (cid:13) τ = zˇ. Consider a
ω
strategy for Player I in the diagonal game in which he plays conditions p ∈P
n n
and on the side produces P -names τ ∈ M so that p ≤ p, τ = τ and
n n n 0 0
p (cid:13) τ =τ evaluatedbytheπ -imageofthegenericfilteronP , and
n Pn n n+1 nn+1 n
also p decides the value τ (n) to be some ordinal z(n). The assumptions on
n n
the name τ shows that this is a valid strategy. The initial assumptions on the
coherent sequence of posets show that this is not a winning strategy, so there
must be a play against it such that in the end there is a condition r ≤ p with
π (r) ≤ p for all n ∈ ω. Let τ ∈ M be the names produced during that
0n n n n
counterplay, and let z be the ω-sequence of ordinals obtained. The definitions
showthatforalln∈ω,π (r)(cid:13) τ =zˇ. Itfollowsthatz ∈M foralln∈ω,
0n Pn n n
and therefore r,z are as required in (2).
