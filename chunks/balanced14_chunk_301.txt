the matroid posets in Example 12.2.12 and the coloring posets in 12.2.11 are
not placid. Thus, the placid forcings form a fairly small and tightly controlled
subclass of Bernstein balanced forcings.
Theorem 12.3.1. Let X be an uncountable Polish field and F ⊂X be a count-
able subfield. In cofinally placid extensions of the symmetric Solovay model,
there is no transcendence basis of X over F.
Proof. Letκbeaninaccessiblecardinal. LetP beaSuslinposetwhichisplacid
cofinally below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model derived from κ, and
work in W. Suppose towards contradiction that there is a condition p∈P and
a P-name τ such that p forces τ to be a transcendence basis of X over F. The
name τ and the condition p are definable from ground model parameters and
an additional parameter z ∈ 2ω. Let V[K] be an intermediate model obtained
by a forcing of cardinality smaller than κ such that z ∈ V[K] and P is placid
in V[K]. Work in V[K].
Let p¯ ≤ p be a placid virtual condition. Consider the closed set Y =
{(cid:104)x ,x ,x ,x (cid:105) ∈ X4: x x + x x = 1} equipped with the topology inher-
0 1 2 3 0 2 1 3
ited from X4, and consider the associated Cohen poset P . Theorems 3.2.7
Y
and 3.1.4 show that the poset P adds a quadruple (cid:104)x : i ∈ 4(cid:105) of points in
Y i
X such that x ,x are mutually Cohen generic elements of X, so are x ,x ,

moreover V[K][x ,x ]∩V[K][x ,x ]=0 and x x +x x =1. For each i∈4,
0 1 2 3 0 2 1 3
the model V[K][x ] contains a poset R of cardinality smaller than κ, an R -

name σ for a condition in P stronger than p¯, and a name η for a finite set

such that the entries of the vector x is forced to be algebraic over η and

Claim 12.3.2. The conditions p for i∈4 have a common lower bound.

Proof. First, p ,p have a lower bound p ∈ V[K][x ,x ][H ,H ] by the bal-

ance of p¯. Similarly, p ,p have a lower bound in V[K][x ,x ][H ,H ] by the

balance of p¯again. Finally, V[K][x ,x ][H ,H ]∩V[K][x ,x ][H ,H ]=V[K]

by the initial choice of the points x for i ∈ 4 and the mutual genericity of the

and p have a common lower bound.

Claim 12.3.3. The set a is not algebraically free.
i i
Proof. By the exchange property of the algebraic matroid, there is a point y ∈
a \V which is in the algebraic closure of (a ∪{x })\{y}. Since y is not an
3 3 3
element of V, it is also not an element of a ∪a ∪a . Since x is algebraic over
0 1 2 3
{x ,x ,x } and each of these points are in turn algebraic over a ,a , and a , it

follows that y is in the algebraic closure of a ∪a ∪a ∪(a \{y}). This proves

the claim.
Thus, the lower bound of the conditions p for i ∈ 4 identifies a finite non-free

set a ⊂X forced to be a subset of τ. This is a contradiction.
