Since the numbers δ tend to 0 as n tends to infinity and D ⊂ B , the
n ini
claim shows that the set D is U-connected and completes the proof of the
proposition.
Proof of Theorem 3.6.2. Suppose towards a contradiction that (cid:104)U,C(cid:105) is a con-
dition in the product P ×P which forces V[x˙ ]∩V[γ˙ ·x˙ ] (cid:54)= V. The

Claim 3.6.9. (cid:104)U,C(cid:105)(cid:13)2ω∩V[x˙ ]∩V[γ˙ ·x˙ ](cid:54)=2ω∩V.

The forcing property of P in question is well-known; we include a complete

Γ such that 1 ∈ V, U(cid:48) ⊂ U, and U(cid:48) ·V ⊂ U. Use Proposition 3.6.5 to find a

Since the fibers of f are µ-null, there must be points x ,x ∈ D such that

These are complementary relatively open subsets of the compact set D, so they
are separated by some distance δ > 0. Use the connectedness of the set D to
