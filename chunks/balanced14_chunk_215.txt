therefore by a path e in the set A . Then e∪d forms a cycle in the set

In the end, let A = A . It is clear from the coherence of the
m n>m mn
well-ordering ≺ that A ∈ M . The construction also guarantees that M |=
m m m
A ⊂ G is a maximal acyclic subset, and m < n implies A ⊂ A . The proof
m n m
is complete.
Corollary 9.4.22. Let X be a Polish space and let G be a Borel graph on X.
1. Let P be the poset of Example 6.4.10 for adding a maximal acyclic subset
of G. In the P-extension of the symmetric Solovay model, the orbit divide
is preserved;
2. it is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, G
has a maximal acyclic subset, and the orbit divide is preserved.
Example 9.4.23. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X of countable
coloring number. The coloring poset P = P of Definition 8.1.1 is nested bal-
Γ
anced.
Proof. We identify P with its dense Suslin subset identified in Theorem 8.1.2.
Let p ∈ P be a condition, and let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be a nontrivial choice coherent
n
(cid:84)
sequence of generic extensions of V, with M = M . We will produce a
ω n n
decreasing sequence (cid:104)p¯: n ≤ ω(cid:105) of balanced virtual conditions below p for the
respective models M . Let (cid:104)a : n ≤ ω(cid:105) be a recursive sequence of pairwise
n n
disjoint infinite subsets of ω.
Claim 9.4.24. Fix n≤ω. In the model M , there is a total Γ coloring d: X →
n
ω which extends p and at all points x∈X\dom(p), d(x)∈a .

(cid:83)
Proof. Work in M . Fix a coloring e: X → ω. Let a = b be a partition
n n i i
of a into infinitely many sets of size m. Let d: X → ω be a function such
n
that p ⊂ d and for all x ∈/ X \dom(p), d(x) is a number in e(x) which is not
one of the (fewer than m many) colors {p(y): (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) ∈ Γ}. This is the desired
coloring.
Let ≺ be a coherent wellordering of P(X ×ω), and for each n ≤ ω let d be
n
the≺-leastcoloringasintheclaiminthemodelM . Finally, inthemodelM ,
n 0
define a map c: X → ω as follows: c(x) = d (x) if x ∈/ dom(p) and n ≤ ω is
n
the largest number such that x∈M , and c(x)=p(x) if x∈dom(p). It is not
n
difficult to check that c is a Γ-coloring extending p. Moreover, the coherence of
thewell-ordering≺guaranteesthatforeachn≤ω,c(cid:22)M ∈M holds. Ineach
n n
model M for n≤ω, the coloring c(cid:22)M is associated with a balanced virtual
n n
condition p¯ for the poset P by Theorem 8.1.2. The sequence (cid:104)p¯ : n ≤ ω(cid:105) is
n Γ n
as desired.
Corollary 9.4.25. Let Γ be the graph on R2 connecting points x ,x if they

have a nonzero rational distance.
