Example 11.1.17. For every n ∈ ω, let H be the hypergraph on n of arity
n
3 consisting of all arithmetic progressions of length 3. Then the fractional
chromatic numbers of H tend to infinity with n–just consider the normalized
n
counting measure on n and the density van der Waerden’s theorem [88].

Borel graphs exemplifying the distinction is the following:
Example 11.1.19. Let E be a Borel non-smooth equivalence relation on a
Polish space X. Let Q be the poset of all pairs q = (cid:104)a ,b (cid:105) of finite subsets of
q q
X such that (a ×b )∩E = 0; the ordering is that of coordinatewise reverse

patible. Then G does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number, yet it does
have Borel σ-bounded fractional chromatic number.
Proof. To show that G does not have Borel σ-bounded chromatic number, first
use the Glimm–Effros dichotomy to find a Borel reduction h: 2ω →X of E to
0
E. For E -unrelated points y ,y ∈ 2ω let r(y ,y ) = (cid:104){h(y )},{h(y )}(cid:105) and

note that r(y ,y ) ∈ Q. By the Baire category theorem, it will be enough, for

any Borel nonmeager set B ⊂ 2ω ×2ω and every n ∈ ω, to produce a finite
subset b ⊂ B such that the chromatic number of G on q(cid:48)(cid:48)b is greater than n.
To this end, let t ,t ∈2<ω be two binary strings of the same length such that

B ⊂ [t ]×[t ] is comeager. Let k ∈ ω be a number such that k → (3)2. A
