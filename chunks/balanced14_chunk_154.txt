following definition.
Definition 7.3.1. A Ramsey sequence of finite structures is a sequence A =
(cid:104)A : n ∈ ω(cid:105) of finite structures in the same language, with pairwise disjoint
n
domains, such that
1. foreverynaturalnumbern∈ω,A containsanisomorphiccopyofA ;
n+1 n
2. for every k < n ∈ ω there is m > n such that the structural Ramsey
property A →(A )Ak holds.
m n 2
For each Ramsey sequence A=(cid:104)A : n∈ω(cid:105) of finite structures, we will use the
n
(cid:83)
following notation. dom(A) stands for dom(A ). Given a number n ∈ ω,
n n
the symbol D stands for the set of all finite sets d such that for some m ∈ ω,
n
d⊂dom(A ) and A (cid:22)d is isomorphic to A . For every set p⊂dom(A), the
m m n
symbol pAn stands for P(p)∩D
n
. Each Ramsey sequence of finite structures
has a natural σ-closed poset associated to it.
Definition 7.3.2. Let A=(cid:104)A : n∈ω(cid:105) be a Ramsey sequence of finite struc-
n
tures. LetP
A
denotetheposetofallsetsp⊂dom(A)suchthatpAn isnonempty
for each n∈ω. The ordering is defined by q ≤p if q ⊆p modulo finite.
It is not difficult to use the Ramsey property of the sequence A to see that
a generic filter on P is in fact an ultrafilter on dom(A); the combinatorial
A
properties of this generic ultrafilter are the reason for the study of these posets
in[8]. TheposetsoftheformP arebalanced. Thebalancedvirtualconditions
A
are parametrized by sequences of ultrafilters as opposed to single ultrafilters in
the case of P(ω) modulo finite.
Definition 7.3.3. Let A=(cid:104)A : n∈ω(cid:105) be a Ramsey sequence of finite struc-
n
tures. An A-sequence of filters is a sequence (cid:104)F : n∈ω(cid:105) such that
n
1. for every number n∈ω, F is a filter on the set D ;
n n
2. for all numbers n,m ∈ ω and every selection (cid:104)a : i ∈ n(cid:105) of sets in the
i
respective filters F
i
for i ∈ n, there is a set d ∈ D
m
such that dAi ⊂ a
i
holds for all i∈n.
