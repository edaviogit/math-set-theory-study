uncountable Borel chromatic number. Thus, it is enough to prove the conclu-
sion of the theorem for Γ.
Supposethatκisaninaccessiblecardinal. SupposethatP isaSuslinforcing
such that P is definably balanced below κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay
model derived from κ and work in W. Let p ∈ P be a condition and let τ be
a P-name for a function from X to ω; we must find a Γ-edge (cid:104)x : m ∈ ω(cid:105), a

for all m ∈ ω. The condition p as well as the name τ are defined from some
parameters in the ground model and perhaps an additional parameter z ∈ 2ω.
Find an intermediate extension V[K] of the ground model using a poset of size
<κ such that z ∈V[K], and work in the model V[K].
Let Q be the product of uncountably many copies of Cohen forcing. By the

which uses only η as a parameter. By Fact 14.4.6, passing to an intermediate
extension if necessary we may assume that η is in fact a name for a specific
element of the ground model. For the sake of brevity, we ignore η and q below.
By a balance argument with p¯, Q (cid:13) ∀x ∈ X ∃kColl(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p¯(cid:13) τ(xˇ) = kˇ.

Let h˙ be the Q-name for the map x (cid:55)→ k; thus, h˙ is forced to be a definable

Consider the Cohen poset P with its name x˙ for a generic point of the

Corollary 14.4.8. 1. Let P be the poset for adding a nontrivial automor-
phismofthealgebraP(ω)modulofiniteofSection8.3. IntheP-extension
of the Solovay model, there is no discontinuous homomorphism between
Polish groups.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
there is a nontrivial automorphism of P(ω) modulo finite, and there is
no discontinuous homomorphism between Polish groups.
Proof. The poset P is definably balanced by Example 14.4.4. It is clearly σ-
closed, so in the P-extension of the Solovay model, ZF+DC holds. By Theo-

is uncountable.. By a ZF+DC result of [76], this abstractly implies that there
are no discontinuous homomorphisms between Polish groups.
