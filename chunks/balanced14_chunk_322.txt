Corollary 13.3.10. Let E be a pinned Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X.
1. Let P be the transversal poset of Example 6.6.8. In the P-extension of the
symmetric Solovay model, there are no discontinuous homomorphisms of
Polish groups.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds,
E has a transversal, and yet there is no discontinuous homomorphism
between Polish groups.
The next batch of examples deals with partial orders which are m,n-balanced
but not 3,2-centered, and violate the conclusions of various preservation theo-
rems for 3,2-centered posets from Section 13.2.
Example 13.3.11. Let Γ be a Borel graph on a Polish space X. Let P be
the poset of all countable acyclic subsets of Γ ordered by reverse inclusion.
Whenever n ∈ ω is a natural number, the poset P is n,2-balanced and every
balanced virtual condition is n,2-balanced.
The poset P adds a maximal acyclic subset of Γ, violating the conclusion of
Theorem 13.2.5 for many graphs Γ. Therefore, in such cases the poset P is not
3,2-centered and even does not contain a dense analytic 3,2-centered subset.
Proof. It follows from Example 6.4.10 that balanced virtual conditions for P
are classified by maximal acyclic subgraphs of Γ. Let p¯be any maximal acyclic
subgraph of Γ. We will check that p¯ is n,2-balanced, completing the proof.
To this end, let {V[H ]: i ∈ n} be pairwise mutually generic extensions of V,

respectively containing some conditions p ≤p¯for each i∈n.

Claim 13.3.12. For each i∈n and vertices x ,x ∈X∩V, the following three
0 1
formulas are equivalent:
1. x ,x are connected by a path in Γ∩V;
0 1
2. x ,x are connected by a path in p¯;
0 1
3. x ,x are connected by a path in p .
0 1 i
Proof. (1)→(2) is implied by the maximality of p¯. (2)→ (3) follows from the
fact that p¯⊂p , and the negation of (1) implies by the Mostowski absoluteness

than p and therefore (3) has to fail.
