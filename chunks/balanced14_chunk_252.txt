11.3. ITERATION THEOREMS 265
Theorem 11.2.7 follows.
The operation of the finite support product appears to be more difficult to
handle. Here the main question remains open:
Question 11.2.15. TheclassofSuslinc.c.c.forcingsisclosedundercountable,
finite support product. Is this true for the class of very Suslin c.c.c. forcings as
well?
11.3 Iteration theorems
The posets we use later in this chapter are fairly innocent from ZFC point of
view. However, we need their regularity properties to be witnessed in a Suslin
way, and to be preserved under finite support iterations of countable length.
This section contains a number of rather routine, but still apparently novel,
regularity properties and their associated preservation theorems.
Definition 11.3.1. Let P be a Suslin forcing.
1. A set A ⊂ P is linked if any two conditions in A have a common lower
bound;
(cid:83)
2. P is Suslin σ-linked if P can be written as a countable union A of
n n
linked analytic sets.
NotethatthedefinitorypropertiesofthecoverP = (cid:83) A areΠ1 andtherefore

persist to all forcing extensions. The main general result of this section is the
iteration preservation theorem for Suslin σ-linkedness:

α is a Suslin σ-linked forcing.
Proof. The argument proceeds by a straightforward transfinite induction argu-
ment given the following two claims.
Claim 11.3.3. Let P,Q be very Suslin c.c.c. forcings, both of which are Suslin
σ-linked. The P ∗Q˙ is Suslin σ-linked.
