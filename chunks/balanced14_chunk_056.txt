argest such structure then is of size 2λ exactly.
This completes the proof.

rigid structures such that κ(E )=(cid:105)+.

Definition 2.5.16. Let Γ be a coanalytic class consisting of structures on ω
invariantunderisomorphism. Γ+ istheclassofstructuresonω ofthefollowing
description. A structure M ∈Γ+ has a linear order ≤ . Moreover, writing L
M n
for the set {m ∈ M: m ≤ n}, the structure M induces a Γ-structure M on
M n
L for coboundedly many n ∈ M such that for distinct elements n ,n ∈ M,
n 0 1
the structures (cid:104)M ,≤ (cid:105) and (cid:104)M ,≤ (cid:105) are nonisomorphic.

Proposition 2.5.17. Let Γ be a coanalytic class of structures on ω, invariant
under isomorphism.
1. Γ+ is coanalytic;
2. if Γ is Borel and consists of rigid structures, then Γ+ is Borel and consists
of rigid structures;
3. if Γ consists of rigid structures, then κ(Γ+)=κ(Γ)+.
Proof. (1)isclear. For(2),therigidityconclusionisclear. ToseetheBorelness
of the class Γ+ note that the statement “(cid:104)M,≤ (cid:105) is isomorphic to (cid:104)N,≤ (cid:105)”
M N
for structures M,N ∈ Γ is Borel by the rigidity of the structures in Γ and the
Lusin–Suslin theorem [55, Theorem 15.1]. For (3), write κ = κ(Γ). To show
that κ(Γ+) ≤ κ+, use Theorem 2.4.5 to argue that every virtual E class is
Γ+
classified by (Γ+)∗∗-structure. Such a structure contains a linear ordering, and
on cofinally many initial segments of the ordering there is a Γ∗∗-structure. It
follows that every initial segment of the ordering is of cardinality less than κ,
so the underlying set has size at most κ.
To show that κ(Γ+)≥κ+, treat first the case that κ is a limit cardinal. Let
M be the structure on κ which includes the usual ∈-ordering on κ and on each
cardinal λ < κ on which there is a Γ∗∗-structure, M contains one. This is a
(Γ+)∗∗-structure of size κ, so κ(Γ+)≥κ+.
Suppose now that κ is a successor cardinal, κ=λ+. This means that there
is a Γ∗∗-structure N of size λ. Let M be the structure on κ which includes the
usual ∈-ordering of κ and on each ordinal µ < κ of cardinality λ, it contains a
copy of N. This is a (Γ+)∗∗-structure of size κ, so κ(Γ+) ≥ κ+ in this case as
well. The proof is complete.
Corollary 2.5.18. For every countable ordinal α > 0 there is a Borel equiva-
lence relation E such that (provably) κ(E)=ℵ .

Proof. Now, by recursion on a countable ordinal α construct a Borel class Γ
