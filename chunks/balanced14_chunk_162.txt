te that two conditions p ,p ∈P are
0 1
compatible just in case they are compatible as functions: then p ∪p will be

their lower bound. To argue for the ℵ -distributivity, let p ∈ P be a condition

Claim 8.1.5. P is a dense subset of P .
Γ
Proof. It is first necessary to show that P is a subset of P . To this end, let
Γ
p ∈ P. Let {b : k ∈ ω} be a collection of pairwise disjoint infinite subsets of
k
ω and c: X → ω be a total Γ-coloring. Let d: X → ω be the function defined
as follows: d(x) = p(x) if x ∈ dom(p), and otherwise let d(x) be the smallest
number in b which is different from the finitely many numbers {p(y): y ∈
c(x)
dom(p) and {x,y}∈Γ}. It is not difficult to verify that d is a total Γ-coloring
extending p, and so p∈P (Γ).
ω
For the density, suppose that p ∈ P is a condition. Let c: X → ω be a
Γ
total Γ-coloring extending p. Let M be a countable elementary submodel of a
large structure containing p,c, and ≺. By Claim 8.1.3, the set {y ∈X: ∃∞x∈
M {x,y}∈Γ} is a subset of M. Thus, the function q =c(cid:22)M is a condition in
P extending p as desired.
For the classification of the balanced virtual conditions, we need a claim:
Claim 8.1.6. Let R ,R be posets and η ,η be respective R - and R -names

1. R forces η to be Γ-connected with at most finitely many elements of the

2. R ×R (cid:13){η ,η }∈/ Γ.

Proof. For the first item, suppose towards a contradiction that this fails as

a large structure containing all relevant information, let g ⊂R ∩M be a filter
