ic extension V[K] of V by a poset of cardinality
smaller than κ such that z ∈V[K] and P is perfectly balanced in V[K]. Work
in the model V[K]. Let p¯≤ p be a perfectly balanced virtual condition in P.

302 CHAPTER 12. THE SILVER DIVIDE
Since Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) p (cid:13) τ is not covered by countably many Γ-anticliques,
P
and a closure of a Γ-anticlique is still a Γ-anticlique, there must be a poset R
of cardinality smaller than κ, an R-name η for an element of X which belongs
to no closed Γ-anticlique coded in V[K], and an R-name σ for a condition in P
stronger than p¯such that R(cid:13)Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)σ (cid:13) η ∈τ.

In the end, for every binary sequence y ∈2ω let H ⊂R be the filter generated
y
by the conditions {r y(cid:22)n : n ∈ ω}. Note that any finite tuple of distinct filters
H for y ∈ 2ω is mutually generic over the model V[K] by the second item in
y
the inductive construction above. The mutual genericity also shows that the
function y (cid:55)→ η/H is a continuous injection from 2ω to X, and its range is a
y
Γ-clique by the third item above. By the perfect balance of the condition p¯,
there is a perfect set C ⊂ 2ω such that the conditions {σ/H : y ∈ C} have a
y
lowerboundq intheseparativequotientoftheposetP. Bytheforcingtheorem
applied in every model V[K][H] for H ∈C it is the case that in the model W,
the condition q forces the perfect Γ-clique {η/H: H ∈ C} to be a subset of τ.
The proof is complete.
Now it is time for a list of perfect and perfectly balanced forcings.
Example 12.1.9. Let I be an F -ideal on ω. The poset P of all I-positive
σ
subsets of ω ordered by inclusion is perfect.
As a special case, this includes the poset of infinite subsets of ω ordered by
inclusion of Section 7.1 and the posets of Section 7.3, both adding ultrafilters
on ω with various Ramsey properties.
Proof. Recall that P(I) is the poset of all I-positive subsets of ω, ordered by
(cid:83)
inclusion. Write I = I as a countable union of closed sets, each of which is
