Proof. (2) immediately implies (1) by considering the P × P extension. To
see how (1) implies (2), suppose that V[H] is a forcing extension and in V[H]
there are filters G ,G ⊂ P separately generic over V. Let G ⊂ P be a filter

The following is the archetypal example of a non-trivial pinned name.
Example 2.1.3. Consider the poset P = Coll(ω,2ω) and its name τ for the
generic surjection from ω to (2ω)V. The name τ is F -pinned since no matter

(2ω)V. Clearly, it is a nontrivial name since the set 2ω is uncountable, so there
is no ground model element of (2ω)ω that can enumerate it and be equivalent
to τ.
Given an analytic equivalence relation E on a Polish space X, the E-pinned
namesformaseeminglyinexhaustibleandcomplicatedclass. However,thisclass
admits a natural equivalence relation which usually greatly clarifies matters:
Definition 2.1.4. Let E be an analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space
X. Supposethat(cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)and(cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105)areE-pins. Define(cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)E¯ (cid:104)R,σ(cid:105)ifP×Q(cid:13)
τ E σ.
Proposition 2.1.5. The relation E¯ is an equivalence. If P,Q are posets with
E-pinned names τ,σ on them, the following are equivalent:
1. (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)E¯ (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105);
2. in every forcing extension, if G ⊂ P and H ⊂ Q are filters separately
generic over the ground model, then τ/GE σ/H holds.
Proof. E¯ is clearly symmetric and reflexive by its definition. To see the tran-
sitivity, suppose that (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105) E¯ (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105) E¯ (cid:104)P ,τ (cid:105). This means that P ×

Now, (2) immediately implies (1) by considering the P ×Q extension. To
see how (1) implies (2), suppose that V[K] is a forcing extension and in V[K]
there are filters G ⊂ P,H ⊂ Q separately generic over V. Let H(cid:48) ⊂ Q be a
filter generic over V[K]. By the product forcing theorem, G,H(cid:48) are mutually
generic filters, and so are H,H(cid:48). Applying the assumption (1), we see that
τ/G E σ/H(cid:48) E σ/H, so τ/G E σ/H by the transitivity of the equivalence
relation E.
