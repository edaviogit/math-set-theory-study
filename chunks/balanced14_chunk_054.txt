and consider Q = P ∩M and σ = τ ∩M; so |Q| = κ. As M is correct about
pinned names and the equivalence E¯ by a Shoenfield absoluteness argument, σ
is an E-pinned name on Q and it is not E¯-equivalent to any pinned names on
posets of size <κ.
Thus,assumethattheposetP hassizeκ. Letj: V →N beanyelementary

The last theorem in this section provides an estimate of the λ cardinal for
unpinned equivalence relations. The well-known Silver dichotomy says that
every Borel equivalence relation with uncountably many classes has in fact 2ℵ0
many classes. We would like to show that every unpinned Borel equivalence
relation has at least 2ℵ1 many virtual classes. However, in ZFC this is still
open. The best we can do is the following.
Theorem 2.5.11. Let E be an unpinned Borel equivalence relation. Let κ be
an inaccessible cardinal. Then Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)λ(E,Coll(ω,ω
1
))=2ℵ1.
Proof. Let A ⊂ P(κ) be a set of size 2κ such that all elements of A have
cardinalityκandanytwodistinctelementsofAhaveintersectionofcardinality
<κ. RecallthattheposetP =Coll(ω,<κ)isafinitesupportproductofposets
Coll(ω,α) for α ∈ κ. For every set a ⊂ κ write P = Π Coll(ω,α) ⊂ P. Let
a α∈a
G⊂Coll(ω,<κ) be a generic filter. Use Theorem 2.7.1 to argue that for every
a∈A, V[G∩P ]|=E is unpinned, and let (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105)∈V[G∩P ] be a nontrivial

E-pinned name with its attendant poset. It will be enough to show that the
pairs (cid:104)Q ,τ (cid:105) for a∈A represent pairwise distinct virtual classes.

Suppose towards a contradiction that for some a (cid:54)= b in the set A the E-
pinnednamesτ ,τ areequivalent. Letc=a∩bandworkinthemodelV[G∩P ].

The assumptions imply that the poset (P ∗Q˙ )×(P ∗Q˙ ) forces (at least

P ∗Q˙ is E-pinned. Since the equivalence relation E is Borel, it follows that
