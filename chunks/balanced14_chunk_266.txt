class as a,b on one side of the bipartition, the set of G(cid:48)-neighbors of c has size
at least |c|. There are two cases:
Case 1. There is a G2-path from some vertex in a to some vertex in b using
onlynodesincastheintermediatesteps. Inthiscase,withoutlossofgenerality
suppose that |a| ≥ |b|, and use the definition of supp(a) to argue that the G2-
path from a to b must contain at least 4|a|/ε-many steps. This means that
|c| > 4|a|/ε. By the initial condition on the graph G, the set c has at least
(1+ε)|c| many G-neighbors and so at least (1+ε)|c|−2|a|−2|b| many G(cid:48)-
neighbors. However, 2|a|+2|b| < ε|c| and so the set c has at least |c|-many
G(cid:48)-neighbors as required.
Case 2. Case1fails. Inthiscase,thesetccanbewrittenasaunionofdisjoint

Then, since a∈K, the set c has at least |c |-many G(cid:48)-neighbors; since b ∈K,

the set c has at least |c |-many G(cid:48)-neighbors. The G(cid:48)-neighborhoods of c ,c

G(cid:48)-neighbors as desired.
Note that as the graph G is locally finite, maximal K-sets are in fact perfect
G-matchings.
Corollary 11.4.17. Let G be a locally finite Borel bipartite graph on a Polish
space X satisfying the Marks–Unger condition. Let K be the simplicial complex
of partial G-matchings that can be extended to a perfect matching. Let H be an
analytic graph of uncountable Borel chromatic number.
1. In the P -extension of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of H is
K
uncountable;
2. itisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is a perfect G-matching, and the chromatic number of H is uncountable.
Question 11.4.18. Is there a locally finite, bipartite Borel graph G satisfying
the Marks–Unger condition such that the associated control poset is not Suslin
σ-centered? Such that in ZF+DC, the existence of perfect matching for G is
equivalent to some Borel hypergraph having countable chromatic number?
To many hypergraphs of arity greater than two it is possible to add a coloring
while preserving uncountable chromatic numbers of analytic graphs purely as a
matter of arity. Consider the following:
Example 11.4.19. Let Z act on a Polish space X in a Borel free way. Let G
be the hypergraph of all triples {x ,x ,x } such that there is n ∈ ω such that

n·x = x and n·x = x . Let K be the simplicial complex of partial finite

colorings of the hypergraph G with colors coming from ω. The complex K is
