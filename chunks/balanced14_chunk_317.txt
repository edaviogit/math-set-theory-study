containing z obtained by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ and such that
P is balanced in V[K]. Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a balanced
virtual condition in P. By the cofinal balance assumption, there must be a
poset Q of cardinality smaller than κ, a Q-name η for an element of X which
does not belong to V[K], and a Q-name σ for a balanced virtual condition
in the Q-extension which is stronger than p¯. Let H ,H ,H ⊂ Q be filters

Theorem 13.2.7. Let E be a pinned Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. In 3,2-centered, tethered, and cofinally balanced extensions of the
symmetric Solovay model, the following are equivalent:
1. E has a transversal;
2. the E-quotient space is linearly ordered.
Proof. The implication (1)→(2) is trivial. In ZF, the space X, as every Polish
space, carries a Borel linear ordering ≤. If A⊂X is an E-transversal, then one
can order the E-quotient space by setting c ≺ d if the unique element of A∩c
is ≤-smaller than the unique element of A∩d. The implication (2)→(1) is the
heart of the matter.
Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin forcing which is 3,2-
centered, balanced cofinally below κ and tethered below κ. Let W be a sym-
metric Solovay model derived from κ and work in W. Suppose that p∈P is a
conditionforcingE nottohaveatransversal. Supposethatτ isaP-namefora
tournament on the E-quotient space. We will find a 3-cycle on the E-quotient
space and a condition stronger than p which forces the cycle to be a subset of
τ. This will prove the theorem.
The condition p and the name τ are definable from some ground model
parameters and an additional parameter z ∈ 2ω. As a provisional definition,
call a tuple (cid:104)M,p¯,Q,η,σ(cid:105) symmetric if M is an intermediate generic extension
of V by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ such that z ∈ M, p¯ ≤ p is a
balanced virtual condition in the model M, Q ∈ M is a poset of cardinality
