Then, in the model W, their lower bound forces that τ([yˇ0]E )=τ([yˇ1]E )=uˇ.

This contradicts the assumption that τ was forced to be an injection.
Example 9.2.4. LetP betheposetofP(ω)modulofinite. ByTheorem7.1.2,
the balanced virtual conditions are classified by nonprincipal ultrafilters on ω.
Equip the set of balanced classes by the topology of the remainder βω. It is
immediate that the topology witnesses the fact that P is compactly balanced.

Example 9.2.6. Let A be a Ramsey sequence of finite structures and P the

Claim 7.3.6 confirms the extension property Definition 9.2.1(2). It follows that
the poset P is compactly balanced.
