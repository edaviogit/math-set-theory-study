defined from the ordinal λ and the ultrafilter G, so C ∈M.
BythegenericityofthefilterG,theremustbeaconditionp∈Gwhichisbelow
all conditions in C and incompatible with all the conditions in D\C. By the

10.2. PINNED UNIFORMIZATION 241
forcing theorem, in M there have to be a poset Q of cardinality less than κ and
a Q-name τ fora conditionin P such that Q forces τ to be belowall conditions
in C and incompatible with all conditions in D\C, and such that there is a
filter H ⊂ Q generic over the model M with p = τ/H. We claim that in the
model M, the pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is balanced.
To see this, suppose towards contradiction that R ,R are posets and K ×

H ⊂ R ×Q and K ×H ⊂ R ×Q are filters mutually generic over the

model M and p ,p are conditions in the respective models below τ/H and

τ/H respectively. We must show that p ,p are compatible. This, however,

is immediately clear from the λ-tether assumption and the fact that for every
virtual condition p¯on P represented on a poset of cardinality less than λ and
for every i ∈ 2, p¯ ≥ p ↔ p¯ ∈ C and p¯ is incompatible with p if and only if
i i
p¯∈/ C.
Still working in the model M, let p¯ be a virtual balanced condition in the
balance class of (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105), obtained from Theorem 5.2.5. Clearly, the filter G
contains a realization of it.
Return to the model W for a moment. Let p ∈ G be a condition and let τ be
a P-name for a subset of 2ω×X such that each vertical section of τ is a single
E-class. Let z ∈ 2ω be a point such that both p,τ are definable from z and a
ground modelparameter. Back inthe model W[G], write B =τ/G. Let y ∈2ω
be an arbitrary point and let M be the model of all sets hereditarily definable
y
from G,y, and parameters in the ground model. By Claim 10.2.3, there is a
balanced virtual condition p¯ in M whose realization belongs to the filter G.

Necessarily, p¯≤p.
In the model M , we will show that Coll(ω,<κ)(cid:13)p¯(cid:13) τ ∩M (cid:54)=0. Once

To prove the forcing statement in the previous paragraph, suppose towards
a contradiction that it fails. Move to the model M . There have to be a
y
poset R of size < κ and R-names σ for a condition in P stronger than p¯ and
η for an element of X which has no E-equivalent in the model M such that

R (cid:13) Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) (cid:104)yˇ,η(cid:105) ∈ τ. In W, let H ,H ⊂ R be filters mutually

generic over the model M . Write p =σ/H , p =σ/H , x =η/H and x =

conditions with a lower bound q. The pinned assumption on the equivalence
relation implies that x ,x ∈X are not E-related.

Theorem 10.2.2 is the strongest possible result of its kind, as the following
observation shows.
Theorem 10.2.4. Let E be an unpinned Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. Then E-uniformization fails in balanced extensions of the Solovay
