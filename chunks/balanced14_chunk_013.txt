Theorem 1.3.9. (Corollary 12.2.13) It is consistent with ZF+DC that there
is a transcendence basis for the reals over Q and there is no diffuse probability
measure on ω.

1.3. INDEPENDENCE: BY TOPIC 9
One traditional fracture line between matroids leads between the modular ones
(like the matroid of linearly independent sets) and the non-modular ones (like
the matroid of algeraically independent sets). We develop an abstract notion
of modularity in Definition 6.4.1 and, improving on earlier work of [79, 12], we
prove:
Theorem 1.3.10. (Corollary 12.3.8) Let X be a Borel vector space over a
countable field Φ. Let Y be an uncountable Polish field with a countable subfield
Ψ. It is consistent with ZF+DC that there is a Hamel basis for X over Φ but
no transcendence basis for Y over Ψ.
Matroid theorists also distinguish between linear matroids (like the matroid of
linearly independent sets) and graphoids (the matroids of finite acyclic subsets
of a given graph). This distinction gives rise to the following theorem:
Theorem 1.3.11. Let G be a Borel graph on a Polish space X. It is consistent
with ZF+DC that G contains a maximal acyclic subgraph and there is no Hamel
basis for the reals.
The proof takes an unexpected turn: we prove that in ZF+DC, existence of
a Hamel basis implies that E has a complete countable section, in particular

X and a Fraiss´e class F of relational structures with strong amalgamation, we
can add a F-structure (a structure all of whose finite induced substructures are
in F) on the E-quotient space in a highly controlled way. This results in many
theorems of the following kind:
Theorem 1.3.12. (Corollary 13.3.2) Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on
a Polish space X. It is consistent with ZF+DC that there is a tournament on
X/E while there is no linear ordering on 2ω/E .
