Case 2. Q (cid:13) ∀b ∈ B τ ∪b is not a K-set. Let R and b˙ be a poset and a

absolutenes between the Q- and Q×R-extension. By passing to a condition

Example 6.4.5. Every locally countable Borel simplicial complex is modular.
Proof. Let K be a locally countable Borel simplicial complex on a Polish space
X. Consider the function f: K → (Γ
K
)ℵ0 defined by {c,d} ∈ f(a) just in case
either c ⊆ a or d ⊆ a. The values of the function f are countable sets by the
locally countable assumption on the simplicial complex; it is not difficult to see
thatthefunctionf isBorelinasuitablesense. Themonotonicityofthefunction
f is immediate; this leaves us with verifying the modularity of the function f.
Suppose that a,b ∈ K are finite sets. Suppose first that a ∪ b ∈ K and
{c,d}∈f(a)∩f(b);weneedtoshowthat{c,d}∈f(a)∩f(b). Bythedefinition
of the function f, either c ⊆ a or d ⊆ a, and c ⊆ b or d ⊆ b must hold. Now,
c ⊆ a and d ⊆ b is impossible since c∪d ∈/ K while a∪b ∈ K. For the same
reason, the conjunction d⊆a and c⊆b is impossible as well. This means that
one of c,d must be a subset of both a and b, so of a∩b. The definition of the
function f then shows that {c,d}∈f(a∩b) as required.
Now,supposethata∪b∈/ K;wemustfindanedge{c,d}∈f(a)∩f(b)which
does not belong to f(a∩b). To this end, find an inclusion-minimal set e⊂a∪b
such that e∈/ K, and let c=e∩a and d=e\a. The minimal choice of e shows
that {c,d} ∈ Γ . Since c ⊂ a and d ⊂ b, it is clear that {c,d} ∈ f(a)∩f(b).
