96 CHAPTER 3. TURBULENCE
The following is the central motivation of the notion of a projective pair of
subalgebras:
Proposition 3.5.5. Let B be a Boolean algebra and A ,A be a locally projec-
0 1
tive pair of subalgebras. The following are equivalent:
1. B (cid:13)V[G˙ ∩A ]∩V[G˙ ∩A ]=V;
0 1
2. for every b∈B, the intersection algebra A (cid:22)b∩A (cid:22)b has an atom.
0 1
Proof. Suppose that (2) fails for some b ∈ B. Write C = A (cid:22) b∩A (cid:22) b and
0 1
use Proposition 3.5.3 to argue that C is a projective subalgebra of B (cid:22) b, so
b (cid:13) G˙ ∩Cˇ is a C-generic filter, and since C is nonatomic, G˙ ∩Cˇ ∈/ V. At the
same time, G˙ ∩Cˇ belongs to V[G˙ ∩A ]∩V[G˙ ∩A ], so (1) fails.

Suppose now that (2) holds. Suppose that τ ,τ are A - and A -names for

sets of ordinals and some condition b ∈ B forces τ = τ . Write C = A (cid:22)

b ∩A (cid:22) b and let c be an atom of C. To verify (1), it is enough to argue

that c decides the membership of any given ordinal in τ . However, this follows
0
immediately from Proposition 3.5.3 (2) applied below b.
Finally, we are in a position to give a succinct and principled proof of the main
absoluteness result of this section.
Theorem 3.5.6. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
The statement “E is virtually placid” is absolute among transitive models of set
theory containing the code for E.
Proof. We will show that the statement “E is not virtually placid” is in ZFC
equivalenttothestatement“thereisacountableω-modelM ofalargefragment
of ZFC containing the code for E such that M |= E is not virtually placid”.
This is an analytic statement; therefore, it is absolute among transitive models
of set theory.
Now, the left-to-right implication is immediate: one just needs to take a
countable elementary submodel of a large enough structure to get the requi-
site M. The right-to-left direction is more interesting. Suppose that M is a
countable ω-model containing the code for E which satisfies that E is not vir-
tually placid. Working in the model M, there must be complete algebra B,
complete subalgebras A ,A ⊂ B, and respective A ,A -names τ ,τ for ele-

ments of the underlying space X such that first, B×B (cid:13) ¬(τ ) E (τ ) ,

and second, B (cid:13) V[G˙ ∩A ]∩V[G˙ ∩A ] = V and τ E τ . The subalgebras

A ,A ⊂ B form a locally projective pair in M since they are complete. By
0 1
Proposition 3.5.5 applied in M in the (1)→(2) direction, for every b ∈ B, the
algebra A (cid:22) b∩A (cid:22) b has an atom. Stepping out of the model M, we see
0 1
that the pair A ,A ⊂ B is a projective pair and for every b ∈ B, the algebra
0 1
A (cid:22) b ∩ A (cid:22) b has an atom. By Proposition 3.5.5 applied in the (2)→(1)

direction, B (cid:13) V[G˙ ∩A ]∩V[G˙ ∩A ] = V holds. Moreover, B (cid:13) τ E τ , and

B×B (cid:13)¬(τ ) E (τ ) , since E is absolute between generic extensions of

V and generic extensions of M by Borel absoluteness. In conclusion, E is not
virtually placid in V.
