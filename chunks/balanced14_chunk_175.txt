proposition follows in this case as well.
Proposition 8.5.1 shows that we cannot hope to produce a set mapping with
finite values with no free triple, as such a mapping yields an uncountable se-

balanced extensions.
Definition 8.5.2. Let X be an uncountable Polish space. The fat set mapping
forcing is the poset P of all functions p such that for some countable set d(p)⊂
X, p: [d(p)]2 → P(d(p)) is a set mapping without free triples. The ordering is
defined by q ≤p if d(p)⊂d(q) and p⊂q.
It is clear that P is a σ-closed Suslin forcing. The union of the P-generic set if
a set mapping with countable values and no free triples.
Theorem 8.5.3. Let P be the fat set mapping forcing.
1. Iff: [X]2 →P(X)isanysetmappingwithoutfreetriples,then(cid:104)Coll(ω,X),fˇ(cid:105)
is a balanced pair;
2. if (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) is any balanced pair, there is a set mapping f: [X]2 → P(X)
without free triples such that the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),fˇ(cid:105)
are equivalent;
3. distinct set mappings on X without free triples yield inequivalent balanced
pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.
Proof. For(1),itisclearthatColl(ω,X)(cid:13)fˇ∈P isacondition. LetV[G ],V[G ]

be mutually generic extensions of V, and let p ∈ V[G ],p ∈ V[G ] be condi-

let p be the function defined by d(p) = d(p ) ∪ d(p ), p ∪ p ⊂ p, and if

p(x ,x ) = d(p)\{x ,x }. We must show that p is a common lower bound of

is already in the ground model V by the product forcing theorem, and then
p (a) = p (a) = f(a). Second, we must verify that p has no free triple. Let

b ⊂ d(p) be a triple. If b ⊂ d(p ) or b ⊂ d(p ) holds, then b is not free because

b is not free either.
For (2), let (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) be a balanced pair. Strengthening Q and τ if necessary,
we may assume that Q(cid:13)V ∩X ⊂d(τ) holds. By a balance argument, for any
pointsx ,x ,y ∈X inthegroundmodel,Q(cid:13)yˇ∈τ(xˇ ,xˇ )orQ(cid:13)yˇ∈/ τ(xˇ ,xˇ )
0 1 0 1 0 1
holds. Let f: [X]2 → P(X) be the function defined by y ∈ f(x ,x ) if the
0 1
former alternative in the previous sentence prevails. It is clear that f contains
no free triple since τ is forced to contain none. Thus, it will be enough to show
that Q(cid:13)fˇ⊂τ.
Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Then there must be a con-
dition q ∈ Q and points x ,x ∈ X such that q (cid:13) τ(xˇ ,xˇ ) (cid:54)= fˇ(xˇ ,xˇ ).
