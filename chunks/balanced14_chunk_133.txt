efinition 6.4.1. ABorelsimplicialcomplexKonaPolishspaceX ismodular
if there is a Borel modular function f: K→[Y]ℵ0 for some Polish space Y such
that
1. (monotonicity) f(0)=0 and a⊂b implies f(a)⊂f(b);

2. (modularity) foralla,b∈K,a∪b∈Kifandonlyiff(a)∩f(b)=f(a∩b).
For a K set A⊂X we set f(A)= (cid:83) {f(a): a∈[A]<ℵ0}.
Notethatthepropertiesofthefunctionf arecoanalytic, andthereforetransfer
to any transitive model of set theory by the Mostowski absoluteness, in par-
ticular to all generic extensions. It is not easy to see which Borel simplicial
complexes are modular and which are not. As the simplest initial example, let
X =R viewed as a vector space over the rationals, and let K be the simplicial
complexonX consistingoffinitelinearlyindependentsets. Thesimplicialcom-
plex is modular as witnessed by the modular function f which to each finite set
of reals assigns its linear span.

K are again classified by certain K-sets, as recorded in the following definition:
Definition 6.4.2. LetK beasimplicialcomplexonaPolishspaceX. AK-set
A ⊂ X is strongly maximal if for every Borel collection B ⊂ K at least one of
the following occurs:
1. there are a (cid:54)=a in B such that a ∪a ∈K;
0 1 0 1
2. there is b∈B such that b⊂A;
3. there is a countable set p⊂A such that for no b∈B, p∪b is a K-set.
Fittingly, a strongly maximal set A ⊂ X must be a maximal K-set. For this,
given x ∈ X consider the set B = {{x}} and consult the three options of
Definition 6.4.3. The first option is impossible, the second option yields x∈A,
and the third option shows gives that A∪{x} is not a K-set. The maximality
of the set A follows.
Theorem 6.4.3. Suppose that K is a modular Borel simplicial complex on a
Polish space X and write P =P .
K
1. Whenever A ⊂ X is a strongly maximal set then the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),A(cid:105)
is balanced in P;
2. every balanced pair is equivalent to (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),A(cid:105) for some strongly max-
imal set A⊂X;
3. distinct strongly maximal sets give rise to inequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, under the Continuum Hypothesis the poset P is balanced.
