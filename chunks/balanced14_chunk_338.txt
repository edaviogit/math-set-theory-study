the DC assumption to pick linear orders ≤ for each of them. Let U be a

U. If x(cid:48) E x and y(cid:48) E y are different representatives of the E-classes of x,y,
then there is a number m ∈ ω such that x E x(cid:48) and y E y(cid:48); therefore, the

As a basic negative result, the F -quotient space is not linearly ordered in

W[U]; it even carries no tournament by ???. Another negative result, Theo-
rem 14.6.5 below, shows that the E -quotient space cannot be linearly ordered.

Question 14.6.3. Let X be an uncountable Polish space. Classify the Borel
sets A ⊂ [X]ℵ0 such that in W[U], there is a function f assigning to each set
a∈A an ultrafilter on a.

As a basic negative result in this direction, there is no assignment of ultra-
filters to all countable subsets of X; this follows from ???. As a basic open
instance, letΓ bethe freegroup ontwogenerators actingon 2Γ by shiftand let

seemingly arbitrary question relates to the quotient cardinal question 14.6.1. It
iswell-knownthatE isnotBorelreducibletoE ???. However. theassignment

see this, let ∆ be the acyclic locally finite Cayley graph on X and let ∆(cid:126) be the
orientation of the Cayley graph defined by (cid:104)x,y(cid:105)∈∆(cid:126) if the set of {z ∈X: the
unique injective Cayley path from x to z includes y} belongs to the ultrafilter
assigned to [x] . Clearly, every vertex gets outflow one in the orientation ∆(cid:126).

Question 14.6.4. Classify ultrafilters on ω in W[U]. In particular, for which
Borel ideals I on ω is there an ultrafilter F in W[U] such that I∩F =0?
As the only nontrivial result in this section, we now prove that there is no
ultrafilter in W[U] which is disjoint from the summable ideal.

sion. IntheP-extensionofthesymmetricSolovaymodel, thecomplementgraph
