graph ∆. Let Y be the product (n+1) and let ∆ be the graph on Y which

proceeds just as in Theorem 11.5.6; we only indicate the differences. The space
ωω is naturally replaced with Y. The last paragraph is then amended to the
following.

Strengthening q further if necessary, we may assume that q is one of the finite
sequences used in the definition in the skew product ∆, and the length of q is

and for each number l ∈ |q| let y ∈ ωω be the point resulting from rewriting

the first entry of y past q with l. Thus, the points y form a ∆-clique, they

Example 11.5.9. Let Γ be the graph H . It does not contain an injective
<ω
homomorphic copy of K , since for any point x, the points Γ-connected to it

form a sequence converging to x; therefore, any two distinct points can have
only finitely many common neighbors.
Theorem 11.5.6 now yields

Example 11.5.11. Let(cid:126)r be a sequence of positive real numbers converging to
zero. Let Γ be the graph on X = R2 connecting two points if their Euclidean
distance is on the sequence (cid:126)r. The graph Γ does not contain an injective ho-
momorphic copy of K : if x ,x ∈ X are distinct points and ε > 0 is some

real number, then there are only finitely many points in the plane which are
Γ-connected to both and of > ε-distance to both. Now, if x ,x ,x ∈ X are
0 1 2
distinct points and ε>0 is smaller than half of the minimum distance between
two of the three, we see that every point of the plane is at a distance >ε from
two of the three, and so there are only finitely many points Γ-connected to all
three.
