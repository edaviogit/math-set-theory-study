solves the equation xy =zz as required.
Finally, we move to the much better organized world of 3,2-centered forcings.

13.2. PRESERVATION THEOREMS 333
Theorem 13.2.5. Let Γ be an acyclic Borel graph on a Polish space X such
that the Γ-path connectedness relation is Borel and unpinned. In 3,2-centered,
cofinallybalancedextensionsofthesymmetricSolovaymodel, Γhasnomaximal
acyclic subgraph.
Proof. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin, 3,2-centered poset
which is balanced cofinally below κ. Let W be a symmetric Solovay model
derived from κ. Work in W. Suppose that p∈P is a poset and τ is a P-name
such that p forces τ to be a spanning subset of Γ. We will find a cycle in Γ and
a condition stronger than p which forces the cycle to be a subset of τ.

and an additional parameter in 2ω. Let V[K] be an intermediate extension
containing z obtained by a poset of cardinality smaller than κ and such that
P is balanced in V[K]. Work in the model V[K]. Let p¯ ≤ p be a balanced
virtual condition in P. The equivalence relation E is not pinned in V[K] by
Corollary2.7.3,andthereisanontrivialE-pinnednameontheposetcollapsing
ℵ to ℵ by Theorem 2.6.3. By the cofinal balance assumption, there must

be a poset Q of cardinality smaller than κ, a nontrivial E-pinned Q-name η
for an element of X, and a Q-name σ for a balanced virtual condition in the
Q-extension which is stronger than p¯. Let H ,H ,H ⊂ Q be filters mutually

generic over V[K] and write p¯ = σ/H and x = η/H for i ∈ 3. For distinct

indices i,j ∈3, we conclude by the balance of the condition p¯in V[K] that the
