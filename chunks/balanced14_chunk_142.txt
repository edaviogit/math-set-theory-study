Proof. Suppose towards a contradiction that this fails. Then there must be a
finite set b ⊂ A and a condition r ∈ R(cid:48) such that r (cid:13) ˇb ∪ σ(cid:48) ∈/ K. By

the complexity assumption on K, strengthening the condition r if necessary we
can find a closed set C ⊂ K(X) in the model M such that C ∩K = 0 and
r (cid:13)ˇb∪σ(cid:48) ∈C. Now, step out of the model M. The poset R forcesˇb∪σ ∈/ C;

thus, there is a basic open set O ⊂K(X) in the Vietoris topology disjoint from
