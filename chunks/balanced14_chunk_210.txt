ompleting the proof.
It turns out that one large class of nested balanced posets has already been
isolated in Definition 9.2.1:
Example 9.4.7. Every compactly balanced Suslin poset is nested balanced.

220 CHAPTER 9. PRESERVING CARDINALITIES
Proof. Let P be a compactly balanced Suslin poset and p ∈ P be a condition.
LetU ⊂P(ω)modulofiniteand(cid:104)x : n∈ω(cid:105)bemutuallygenericultrafilterand
n
Sacks reals added with full support product. Let (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) be the sequence
n
of models determined by M = V[U,y : m ≥ n]; this is a choice-coherent
n m
sequence by Theorem 4.3.5 or Example 4.3.4 applied in the model V[U]. We
will produce a descending sequence of balanced virtual conditions as required
by Definition 9.4.1.
It is well known [84] that the Sacks real product adds no independent re-
als, and therefore, by a genericity argument, U generates an ultrafilter on ω
in the model M . The generating set of U is present already in the model
0
(cid:84)
M = M . For each number n ∈ ω, use the extension property (2) of Def-
ω n n
inition 9.2.1 repeatedly to find a sequence (cid:104)p¯(ω,n),p¯(m,n): m ≤ n(cid:105) such that
p¯(ω,n) is a balanced virtual condition in M , each p¯(m,n) is a balanced vir-
ω
tual condition in the model M , and p ≥ p¯(ω,n) ≥ p(n,n) ≥ p¯(n−1,n) ≥
m
p¯(n−2,n) ≥ ...; also, demand that each virtual condition p¯(m,n) is selected

tions on P. It is not difficult to see that the resulting system is coherent in the
sensethatforeachn≤ω,thesystem(cid:104)p(m,k): m=ωandk ∈ωork ≥m≥n(cid:105)
belongs to the model M .

Finally, use the compactness of the space of balanced virtual conditions to
define p¯ for n ≤ ω to be the U-limit of the sequence (cid:104)p¯(n,k): k ≥ n(cid:105). Each
n
p¯ is a balanced virtual condition in the model M , m ≤ n ≤ ω implies that
n n
p¯ ≤ p¯ ≤ p by the closedness demands (1) and (3) of Definition 9.2.1. It

follows that the sequence (cid:104)p¯ : n≤ω(cid:105) is as required in Definition 9.4.1.

Corollary 9.4.8.
1. LetP betheposetP(ω)modulofinite. IntheP-extensionofthesymmetric
Solovay model, the orbit divide is preserved.
2. ItisconsistentrelativetoaninaccessiblecardinalthatZF+DCholds,there
is a Ramsey ultrafilter on ω, and the orbit divide is preserved.
Proof. This is a conjunction of Example 9.2.4 and Theorem 9.4.4.
Question 9.4.9. Is there a Borel (or even F ) ideal I on ω such that the
σ
existence of an ultrafilter disjoint from I implies in ZF+DC that |E |≤|E| for
1
some orbit equivalence relation E?
Corollary 9.4.10. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X.
1. In the extension of the Solovay model by the E-linearization poset of Ex-
ample 8.6.5, the orbit divide is preserved.
2. It is consistent relative to an inaccessible cardinal that ZF+DC holds, the
E-quotient space is linearly ordered, and the orbit divide is preserved.
