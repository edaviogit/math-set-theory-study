he assumption (1), we see that
τ/G E σ/H(cid:48) E σ/H, so τ/G E σ/H by the transitivity of the equivalence
relation E.

2.2. VIRTUAL STRUCTURES 39
1. The E¯-classes are referred to as the virtual E-classes;
2. if z is a virtual E-class and in some generic extension V[G] y is an E-
class, we say that y is a realization of z if for some (equivalently, all)
representatives (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)∈z and x∈y, V[G]|=P (cid:13)τ E xˇ holds.
The following proposition is used throughout this book. It says that E-classes
represented in mutually generic extensions must be realizations of a virtual E-
class in the ground model.

X. Let P ,P be partial orders and G ⊂ P and G ⊂ P be mutually generic

The main question surrounding the virtual E-classes is whether they can be
classified in some informative way. Is there a proper class of virtual E-classes
or just a set? If there is just a set, what is its cardinality? Do virtual E-classes

many good answers to similar questions, even though many problems remain
unsolved.
2.2 Virtual structures
It is now possible to define virtual versions of quotient structures on Polish
spaces.
Definition 2.2.1. Ananalyticquotientstructure isatupleM=(cid:104)X,E,R : i∈
i
ω,f : j ∈ω(cid:105) where
j
1. X is a Polish space;
2. E is an analytic equivalence relation on X;
3. for every i∈ω, R
i
⊂Xni is an analytic relation which is invariant under
E;
4. for every j ∈ ω, f
j
⊂ Xmj+1 is an analytic relation which is invariant
under E, and in the E-quotient space it is a graph of a function.
The quotient structure M is Borel if all the relations above including E are
Borel.
