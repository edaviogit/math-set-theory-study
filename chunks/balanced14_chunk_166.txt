For(2),supposethat(cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105)isabalancedpair. Strengtheningτ ifnecessary,
we may assume that Q(cid:13)(X ∩V)⊂dom(τ). By a balance argument, for each

(3) is clear. For the last sentence, we prove a claim which will come handy
later.
Claim 8.1.14. Let p ∈ P be a condition and a ⊂ ω be an infinite set. Then
there is a Γ-coloring c: X →ω such that p⊂c and all points not in dom(p) get
a c-color from the set a.
Proof. Use Proposition 8.1.10 to find a coloring d: [X]2 → ω. Fix a collection
(cid:83)
{a : n∈ω} of pairwise disjoint infinite sets such that a ∈a. Consider the
n n n
graph ∆ on X \dom(p) connecting points x,y if there is a point z ∈ dom(p)
such that the set {x,y,z} is linearly dependent. Note that ∆ is a locally count-
able graph, and so its path-connectedness equivalence relation E has all classes
countable. Therefore, one can find a function c: X → ω such that p ⊂ c, for
all x ∈ X \dom(p) c(x) ∈ a holds, and c restricted to any E-class is an
d(x)
injection. To check that c is a Γ-coloring, assume that {x ,x ,x } ∈ Γ is a
0 1 2
tripleofpairwisedistinctpoints. Ifallthreeofthembelongtodom(p)thenthe
the triple is not monochromatic as p is a Γ-coloring. If two of them belong to
dom(p) then so does the third one by the closure properties of dom(p) and we
are in the previous case. If exactly one of the points belongs to dom(p) then
the other two are E-related and assigned a different color by c. Finally, if none
of the points are in dom(p) then the triple is not monochromatic since d is a
Γ-coloring.
Now,letp∈P beacondition. Chooseaninfiniteseta∈J andfindaΓ-coloring
c: X → ω such that p ⊂ c and all points not in dom(p) get a c-color from the
set a. Clearly, Coll(ω,X) (cid:13) cˇ≤ pˇ and so c is the desired balanced condition
stronger than p.
