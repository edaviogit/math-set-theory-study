The verification of Suslin σ-centeredness for a given locally countable Borel
simplicial complex K may look like a formidable challenge. However, there is a
standard trick, recorded in the following theorem, which makes short work of it
in all cases we are aware of.
Theorem 11.4.6. Let K be a locally countable Borel simplicial complex on
a Polish space X and write E = E . Suppose that there is a Borel support
K
function supp: K→[X]<ℵ0 such that
1. supp(a)⊂[a] ;
E
2. whenever {a : i ∈ j} are sets in K, subsets of the same E-class with
i
(cid:83)
pairwise disjoint supports, then a ∈K.
i i
Then K is Borel σ-centered.
Proof. Let Γ be a countable group acting on X in a Borel way such that E
is the resulting orbit equivalence relation. Let a ∈ K and write supp∗(a) =
(cid:83)
{supp(a∩c): c is an E-class}. We say that a tuple (cid:104)b,f(cid:105) is a descriptor of a
if
• b ⊂ B is a finite set consisting of pairwise disjoint basic open subsets of
X such that every element of supp∗(a) belongs to (cid:83) b and no element of
b contains more than one element of supp∗(a);
• f: b→[Γ]<ℵ0 is a function such that whenever O ∈b is an open set, c is
anE-class,andx∈O∩supp(a∩c)isapointthena∩c={γ·x: γ ∈f(O)}.
Note that a indeed has a descriptor since the set supp∗(a) is finite (making the
construction of b as in the first item possible), and for any E-class c the set
supp(a∩c)isasubsetofcby(1)(makingtheconstructionoff asinthesecond
itempossible). Wewillshowthatif{a : i∈j}areelementsofK withthesame

(cid:83)
descriptor (cid:104)b,f(cid:105) then a ∈ K. Since there are only countably many possible
i i
descriptors, and the set of elements of K with a given descriptor is Borel, this
will conclude the proof of the theorem.
(cid:83)
Let c be an E-class; we must show that (a ∩c)∈K. In view of property
i i
(2) of the supp function, it will be enough to show that whenever i (cid:54)= i are
0 1
elements of j then either a ∩ c = a ∩ c or supp(a ∩ c) is disjoint from
i0 i1 i0
supp(a ∩c). Towards this end, suppose that x∈supp(a ∩c)∩supp(a ∩c)
i1 i0 i1
is a point; we have to show that a ∩c = a ∩c holds. Let O ∈ b be an open
i0 i1
set such that x ∈ O, and use the second property of a descriptor to see that
a ∩c=a ∩c={γ·x: γ ∈f(O)}. The theorem follows.
