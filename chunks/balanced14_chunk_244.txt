d G be a hypergraph on a. The
fractional chromatic number of G is the maximum of all numbers Σ f(v)
v∈a
where f: a → [0,1] ranges over all functions such that Σ f(v) ≤ 1 for all
v∈b
G-anticliques b⊂a.

11.1. CENTRAL OBJECTS AND NOTIONS 257
A word about the terminology is in order. In fractional graph theory [78], the
fractional chromatic number is typically defined for graphs only. In the graph
context, the definition above corresponds to the fractional clique number of G,
which is equal to the standard fractional chromatic number of G by a linear
programming duality argument [78, Section 3.1]. In order to maintain coherent
terminology, we neglect this important but for our ends irrelevant point. A
trivial restatement of the fractional chromatic number will be used below: it is
thelargestrealnumberr suchthatthereisaprobabilitymeasureonainwhich
every G-anticlique has mass ≤1/r.
Note that the fractional chromatic number is no greater than the chromatic
number. Justasinthecaseofthechromaticnumber,ifG ,G arehypergraphs

on a ,a respectively and h: a → a is a homomorphism of G to G then
0 1 0 1 0 1
the fractional chromatic number of G is not smaller than the fractional chro-
1
matic number of G . The following examples further elucidate the relationship
0
between the chromatic number and its fractional counterpart.
Example 11.1.15. For every n ∈ ω let G be the graph on [n]2 connecting
n
pairs a,b if the smaller element of a is equal to the larger element of b or vice
versa. Then the chromatic numbers of G tend to infinity with n, but the
n
fractional chromatic numbers remain bounded by 4.
For the former statement, note that if n is such that n → (3)2 then the
m
chromatic number of G is greater than m: if [n]2 = (cid:83) B , then by the
n i∈m i
Ramsey property of n there is i ∈ m and a triple c ⊂ n such that [c]2 ⊂ B ;
i
however, [c]2 clearly contains a G-edge.
For the latter statement, suppose that µ is a probability measure on [n]2,
and let λ be the normalized counting measure on P(n). Let B = {(cid:104)a,x(cid:105) ∈
[n]2×P(n): x contains the smaller number in a but not the larger number in
a}. The vertical sections of B have λ-mass 1/4, so by the Fubini theorem there
must be a horizontal section Bx whose µ-mass is ≥ 1/4. It is not difficult to
check that Bx is a G-anticlique.
Example 11.1.16. Let ε > 0 be a fixed real number. For each n ∈ ω, let
G be the graph on 2n which connects x,y if the set {m ∈ n: x(m) = y(m)}
n
has size at most εn. The fractional chromatic numbers of G tend to infinity
n
with n. To see this, consider the normalized counting measure µ on 2n, the
n
normalizedHammingmetricd on2n,andtheconcentrationofmeasureresults
n
for the Hamming cubes [73, Theorem 4.3.19]: for every δ >0 there is a number
k ∈ ω such that for every n ≥ k and every set b ⊂ 2n of µ -mass greater than
n
δ, the ε-neighborhood of b in 2n in the sense of the metric d has mass greater
n
than 1/2. For each such number n ∈ ω, every set b ⊂ 2n of µ -mass greater
n
than δ contains a G -edge. To produce the edge, consider the automorphism
n
π : 2n →2n defined by π (x)(m)=1−x(m). The set π(cid:48)(cid:48)b has µ-mass greater
n n
than δ again. The ε/2-neighborhoods of the sets b and π(cid:48)(cid:48)b in the sense of
the metric d have both µ mass greater than 1/2 and therefore intersect. It
n n
follows that there must be points x ∈ b and y ∈ π(cid:48)(cid:48)b with d (x,y) ≤ ε , and
n n
then x,π−1y are G -connected elements of the set b.
