1. Whenever (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) is an E -pinned name for some n ∈ ω then it is also
n
E-pinned;
2. whenever (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) is an E-pinned name, there exists a number n ∈ ω and
an E -pinned name (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) such that (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)E¯ (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105).

The transitivity of the relation E then shows that τ on the poset P (cid:22)p is an

Example 2.3.9. The Louveau jump survives into the virtual realm without
change. The Louveau jump of an analytic equivalence relation E on a Polish
space X is the equivalence relation E+L on Y = Xω connecting y ,y ∈ Y
0 1
if for all but finitely many n ∈ ω, y (n) E y (n). The Louveau jump can
0 1
be written as a countable increasing union of countable products of E, which
by Theorems 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 yields a complete analysis of its virtual classes in
terms of virtual E-classes. In particular, if E is pinned then its Louveau jump
is pinned.
The virtual realm also correctly reflects the situation in which the equivalence
classes of one relation consist of countably many equivalence classes of another
one.
Definition2.3.10. LetE,F beanalyticequivalencerelationsonaPolishspace
X. We say that F is countable over E if E ⊂ F and every F-class consists of
countably many E-classes.
Theorem 2.3.11. Let E,F be analytic equivalence relations on a Polish space
X, with F countable over E.
1. If (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) is an E-pinned name then it is F-pinned as well;
2. if (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) is an F-pinned name then there is an E-pinned name (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) such
that (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105)F¯ (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105).
Proof. (1) is immediate. For (2), it will be enough to show that there is a
condition p ∈ P such that τ is an E-pinned name on P (cid:22) p, for then (cid:104)P,τ(cid:105) F¯
(cid:104)P (cid:22)p,τ(cid:105) as desired.
Suppose towards a contradiction that there is no condition p∈P such that
τ is E-pinned on the poset P (cid:22) p. It follows by the forcing theorem that
P ×P (cid:13)¬τ E τ holds. Let M be a countable elementary submodel of a
left right
large structure containing P,τ and the codes for E,F. Use Proposition 1.7.8 to
find an uncountable collection {g : i∈I} of filters on M∩P pairwise mutually
i
generic over the model M. By the Mostowski absoluteness between the models
M[g ,g ] and V for i (cid:54)= j ∈ I, the elements τ/g ∈ X for i ∈ I are pairwise
i j i
F-related, but pairwise E-unrelated, contradicting the initial assumptions on
the relations E,F.
