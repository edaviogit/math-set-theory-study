Definition 8.6.3. Let F be a Fraiss´e class in a finite relational language.

8.6. SATURATED MODELS ON QUOTIENT SPACES 187
1. An F-structure is a structure M in the same language as F such that for
every finite set a⊂dom(M), M (cid:22)a∈F;
2. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X. The E,F-
Fraiss´e poset P consists of conditions p where p is an F-structure whose
domain is a countable subset of the quotient space X/E. The ordering is
defined by q ≤p if dom(p)⊂dom(q) and p=q (cid:22)dom(p).
It is obvious that the poset P introduces a F-structure on the space X/E,
denoted by M˙ . It is not difficult, but at the same time also not particularly
gen
natural, to describe the poset P(F,E) as a quotient simplicial complex poset:
the vertices of the simplicial complex K will be finite F-structures on the E-
quotient space, and a finite set a of vertices belongs to K if all structures in a
areinducedsubstructuresofasinglefiniteF-structureontheE-quotientspace.
It is obvious that the posets P(F,E) and P are naturally co-dense; however,
K
we will never use the simplicial complex presentation of P(F,E). To describe
thebalancedconditionsintheposetP(F,E),supposethatM isanF-structure
on the virtual E-quotient space X∗∗. Let τ be a Coll(ω,(cid:105) )(cid:105) name for the
M ω1
condition π(cid:48)(cid:48)M where π is the map from the virtual space (X∗∗)V to the E-
quotient space of the extension which maps each virtual class to its realization.
Theorem 2.5.6 provides the necessary assurance that the map π is well-defined
and its range is a countable set.
Theorem 8.6.4. Let F be a Fraiss´e class in a finite relational language which
satisfies strong amalgamation. Let E be a Borel equivalence relation on a Polish
space X. Then in the E,F-Fraiss´e poset P,
1. for every F-structure M on X∗∗, the pair (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) is balanced;
ω1 M
2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) there is a F-structure M on X∗∗ such that
the pairs (cid:104)Coll(ω,(cid:105) ),τ (cid:105) and (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) are equivalent;
ω1 M
3. distinct F-structures on X∗∗ yield inequivalent balanced conditions.
In particular, P is balanced.
