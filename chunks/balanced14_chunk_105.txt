106 CHAPTER 4. NESTED SEQUENCES OF MODELS
4.2 Coherent sequences of models
It is clear from the proof of Theorem 4.1.1 that its generalizations will require
codification of decreasing ω-sequences of generic extensions. In addition to the
approachfromTheorem4.1.1, wepaycloseattentiontotheintersectionmodel.
This is the content of the following definitions and theorems.
Definition 4.2.1. Let (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) be an inclusion decreasing sequence of
n
transitive models of ZFC. We say that the sequence is coherent if for every
ordinalλandeverynaturalnumbern, thesequence(cid:104)V ∩M : m≥n(cid:105)belongs
λ m
to M . Given a coherent sequence of models (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105), a sequence (cid:104)v : n∈
n n n
ω(cid:105) is coherent if for every number m∈ω, (cid:104)v : n≥m(cid:105)∈M holds.
n m
Example 4.2.2. Let R for m ∈ ω be any partial orders and let (cid:104)G : m ∈
m m
ω(cid:105) be a sequence of generic filters on the respective posets R added by the
m
(cid:81)
countable supportproduct R . Let M =V[G : m≥n]. Then (cid:104)M : n∈
m m n m n
ω(cid:105) is a coherent sequence of models.
Example 4.2.3. Let x be a set. By recursion on n ∈ ω, define models M
n
by letting M be V and each M be the collection of all sets hereditarily
0 n+1
definable from ordinal parameters and the parameter x∩M in the model M .
n n
The sequence (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) is coherent.
n
Example 4.2.4. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, U a measure on it, and
j: V → M the U-ultrapower, with iterands denoted by j for every ordinal α.

For each n∈ω let M =j (V). The sequence (cid:104)M : n∈ω(cid:105) is coherent.

Definition 4.2.5. A sequence (cid:104)M : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is generic over V if V is a model
n
of ZFC contained in all M for n∈ω and M is a generic extension of M.
n 0
The usual abstract forcing arguments (Fact 1.7.6) show that if the sequence of
models is generic over V then all models M are generic extensions of V and if
n
n∈m are numbers then M is a generic extension of M . Coherent sequences
n m
of models are most often formed as generic extensions of the constant sequence
(cid:104)M =V : n∈ω(cid:105) using the following definitions and theorem.

Definition 4.2.6. Let P,Q be posets. A projection of Q to P is a pair of
order-preserving functions π: Q→P and ξ: P →Q such that
1. π◦ξ is the identity on P;
2. whenever π(q)≤p then q ≤ξ(p);
3. whenever p≤π(q) then there is q(cid:48) ≤q such that π(q(cid:48))≤p.
As the simplest initial example, let P,R be any posets, let R have a largest
element 1 and let Q = P ×R. Then one can consider the projection of Q to
R
P by setting π(p,r)=p and ξ(p)=(cid:104)p,1 (cid:105). An important effect of the demand
R
(3) is that the π-image of the generic filter on Q is a generic filter on P.
