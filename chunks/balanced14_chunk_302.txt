12.3. PLACID FORCING 317
To state the following theorem in full generality, consider a definition.
Definition 12.3.4. A curve graph is a Borel graph Γ on R if there is a Borel

set A ⊂ R2 consisting of graphs of some collection of smooth curves in R2
whichareclosedassubsetsofR2 andcontainnostraightsegments,suchthatA
accumulates around 0 and Γ={{y ,y }∈[R2]2: y −y ∈A or y −y ∈A}.

positive reals accumulating around 0. Let A be the collection of circles around
theoriginwithradiibelongingtoB. Thus, theresultingcurvegraphΓconsists
of pairs of points whose Euclidean distance belongs to B. If B is countable,
then Γ does not contain an injective homomorphic copy of K and therefore

has countable coloring number by [25]. This is in effect Example 8.1.8.
AnotherexampleisobtainedbychoosingaclosedsmoothcurveC containing
no straight segments and passing though the origin such that for some number
n ∈ ω, n many distinct points in the plane belong to at most one translate of
C–perhaps a circle through the origin with n = 3 comes to mind. Let A = C.
The resulting curve graph Γ does not contain an injective homomorphic copy
of K whenever m ∈ ω is a number large enough so that
(cid:0)m(cid:1)

(cid:0)n(cid:1)
holds;

therefore, it has countable coloring number by [25].
Theorem 12.3.5. Let Γ be a curve graph on R2. In cofinally placid extensions
of the Solovay model, the chromatic number of Γ is uncountable.
Proof. Let A ⊂ R2 be the Borel set defining the curve graph Γ. Let κ be an
inaccessible cardinal. Let P be a Suslin poset which is placid cofinally below
κ. Let W be the symmetric Solovay model derived from κ, and work in W.
Suppose towards contradiction that there is a condition p ∈ P and a P-name
τ such that p forces τ to be a coloring from R2 to ω. We must find two Γ-
connected points and a condition stronger than p which forces the two points
to attain the same color in τ. The name τ and the condition p are definable
from ground model parameters and an additional parameter z ∈2ω. Let V[K]
be an intermediate model obtained by a forcing of cardinality smaller than κ
such that z ∈V[K] and P is placid in V[K]. Work in V[K].
Let p¯ ≤ p be a placid virtual condition. Consider the Cohen poset Q on
R2 with its name y˙ for the generic point in R2. There must be a cardinal
gen
λ∈κ, a Q×Coll(ω,λ)-name σ for a condition in the poset P stronger than p¯,
a nonempty open set O ⊂R2 and a number n∈ω such that O (cid:13) Coll(ω,λ)(cid:13)
Q
Coll(ω,< κ) (cid:13) σ (cid:13) τ(y˙ ) = nˇ. Let C be a smooth curve containing no
P gen
straight segments, which is a closed subset of R2, such that C ⊂ A and O
contains some pair of points y ,y such that y −y ∈ C; this is possible as

0 is an accumulation point of A. Let X = {(cid:104)y ,y (cid:105) ∈ R2: y ,y ∈ O and
