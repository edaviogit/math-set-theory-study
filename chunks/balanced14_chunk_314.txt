Let H ⊂ R for i ∈ n be filters mutually generic over the
E i F i i
model V[K][x¯]. Write p =σ /H and y =η /H for i∈n, and look at the set

y =∆ y ⊂ω. There are two hopeless subcases.

Case 1a. The equivalence class [y] is represented in the model V[K][x¯(n)].

Work in the model V[K][x¯(n)]. Use the initial case assumption to find a poset

V[K][x¯][H : i ∈ n] and let p = σ /H . Note that for every j ∈ n+1, the

Case 1b. Case 1a fails. Work in the model V[K][x¯(n)]. Find a poset R , an

The rest of Case 1b is identical to Case 1a. For every index j ∈ n+1,
the models V[K][x¯(i)][H ] for i ∈ n+1\{j} are mutually generic over V[K].

It follows from the n + 1,n-balance assumption on the condition p¯ that the
conditions p for i ∈ n + 1 have a common lower bound, say r ∈ P. The

condition r forces τ([x¯(i)] )=[y ] for all i∈n, and τ(x )=y is not modulo

Now, in the model W let C ⊂ B be the set of all points which are Q-generic
over V[K]. Note that the set C ⊂ B is comeager in O and Borel, and by the
forcing theorem, p¯ (cid:13) ∀x ∈ C τ([x] ) = [f(x)] . Since the set C is Borel
