2. for every balanced pair (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) there is a A-sequence F of ultrafilters such
that the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,2ω),τ (cid:105) are equivalent;
F
3. distinct A-sequences of ultrafilters yield inequivalent balanced pairs.
In particular, the poset P is balanced.

Proof. Write P = P . For the first item, it is necessary to argue that in
A
fact Coll(ω,τ ) (cid:13) τ (cid:54)= 0. To see this, work in the Coll(ω,2ω) extension,

for each number n ∈ ω let D = dom(F ) and fix an enumeration (cid:104)ai : i ∈ ω(cid:105)

of all elements of F . By induction on n ∈ ω, repeatedly using item (2) of
n
Definition 7.3.3 build sets d n ∈ D n such that for every i ∈ n the set dA n i is
a subset of (cid:84) aj. It is immediate that the condition p = (cid:83) d ∈ P is an
j∈n i n n
element of τ .
F
For the balance, suppose that R ,R are posets and σ ,σ are their respec-

tive names for conditions in P such that R forces that for every n ∈ ω and
0
every set a ∈ F , σAn ⊂ a modulo finite holds, and similarly for R ,σ . We

have to show that R ×R forces the conditions σ ,σ to be compatible in P,

which is the same as to say that R ×R forces the intersection σ ∩σ to

contain a copy of A for every number n ∈ ω. To this end, note that the sets

σAn and σAn are forced to diagonalize the ultrafilter F . By Proposition 7.0.2,

their intersection is forced to be infinite, in particular nonempty.
For the second item, we use a simple claim.
Claim 7.3.5. Let p∈P be a condition, n∈ω be a number, and let a⊂D be
n
a set. Then there is q ≤p such that either qAn ⊂a or qAn ∩a=0.
Proof. For each k ∈ ω find a number m ∈ ω such that A → (A )An. Find
k mk k 2
pairwise disjoint finite sets d ⊂ p in D for each k ∈ ω. Use the partition

For definiteness, assume that the set b = {k ∈ ω: (d(cid:48))An ⊂ a} is infinite. Let

q = (cid:83) d(cid:48) and observe that q ≤p works.

Now let (cid:104)Q,σ(cid:105) be a balanced pair. Replacing Q with Q × Coll(ω,2ω) and

from a modulo finite. By a balance argument, it must be the case that either
Q (cid:13) σAn ⊂ aˇ modulo finite, or Q (cid:13) σAn ∩aˇ = 0 modulo finite. Let F

be the
collection of all sets a ⊂ D for which the former option prevails. It is clear

that F is an ultrafilter and that F = (cid:104)F : n ∈ ω(cid:105) is an A-sequence. Since

The third item is immediate. The last sentence of the theorem is not an
entirely formal consequence of the previous work. It needs the following appli-
cation of the axiom of choice.
