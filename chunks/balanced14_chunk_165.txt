air, then there is a Γ-coloring c: X →ω such that
the balanced pairs (cid:104)Q,τ(cid:105) and (cid:104)Coll(ω,X),cˇ(cid:105) are equivalent;

In particular, P is balanced.
Proof. For (1), let c: X → ω be a Γ-coloring. Let V[G ],V[G ] be mutually

p ∈ V[G ] be conditions below c; we must produce a lower bound q ≤ p ,p

For every point x∈X\(d ∪d ), write e (x)={y ∈d : ∃y ∈d x is a linear

the case of e is symmetric. First note that if y ∈e then y cannot belong to

V, as in such a case x would be a linear combination of elements of d and so

an element of d , contradicting the initial choice of x.

y ,z ∈e are distinct points; we must show that there is a linear combination

It follows that φ y −ψ z = ψ z −φ y . The left-hand side of the equation

Now, let d be any countable subspace of X containing both d ,d as subsets.

Write a = d \ (d ∪ d ). Let I be the set {p(cid:48)(cid:48)e (x): x ∈ a} united with
0 1 0 0
{p(cid:48)(cid:48)e (x): x ∈ a}. By the claim and the definition of the ordering on P, I

is a countable set of sets in the ideal J. By the initial assumptions on the ideal
J, there is a set b ∈ J which cannot be covered by finitely many elements of I
and a finite set. The set a can be easily decomposed into infinitely many sets
with the same property, and so there are pairwise disjoint sets b(x) ⊂ ω for
x∈asuchthatnoneofthemcanbecoveredbyfinitelymanyelementsofI and
(cid:83)
a finite set, and such that b(x)∈J. Let q: d→ω be any function such that

We claim that q ≤p ,p is the desired lower bound.

To see that q ∈P, we must show that q is a Γ-coloring. Suppose towards a
