, 1, and 3 hold in this interpretation, but so does Vy( = O), so Axioms O, 1, and 3 cannot refute Vy ( = O) (see 1V 2.8 for  more formal presentation of this argument). Of course, we need more axioms.

=== 第26页 === 12 The foundations of set theory [Ch 1. 36 §6. Relations, functions, and well-ordering The following intuitive picture should emerge from §5. For  given (), there need not necessarily exist  set {: @()}; this collection (or class) may be too big to form  set. In some cases, for example with {:  = }, the collection is provably too big. Comprehension says that if the collection is  sub-collection of  given set, then it does exist. In certain other cases, .. where the collection is finite or is not too much bigger in cardinality than  given set, it should exist but the axioms of §5 are not strong enough to prove that it does. We begin this section with  few more axioms saying that certain sets which should exist do, and then sketch the development of some basic set-theoric notions using these axioms. Axioms 4-8 of ZFC all say that certain collections do form sets. We actual- ly state these axioms in the (apparently) weaker form that the desired collection is  subcollection of  set, since we may then apply Comprehension to prove that the desired set exists. Stating Axioms 4-8 in this way will make it fairly easy to verify them in the various interpretations considered in Chapters VI and VII. Axiom 4. Pairing. YxVyac(xez ayes).  Axiom 5. Union. VF IAVY Wx(xeY  YEF + xe ). Oo Axiom 6. Replacement Scheme. For each formula ¢ without  free, the universal closure of the following is an axiom: vxe  aly (,) > 3Y VxeAayeYo(xy).  By Pairing, for  given  and  we may let  be any set such that xez  pez; then {véz: =   = } is the (unique by Extensionality) set whose elements are precisely  and ; we call this set {, }. {} = {, } is the set whose unique element is . (, > = {{}, {, }} is the ordered pair of  and . One must check that Vx Vy Vx’ Vy (Cxy> = (xX, Yo xXH=xX Apsy). In the Union Axiom, we are thinking of  as  family of sets and postulate the existence of  set  such that each member  of  is  subset of . This justifies our defining the union of the family , or () 7, by UF = {:3Ve (xeY)};

=== 第27页 === Ch. $6) Relations, functions, and well-ordering 13 this set exists since it is also {xe :dVeF(xeY)}. When ¥ + O, we let (\ = {:VVeF (xeEY)}; this set exists since, for any Be , it is equal to {xe : VYeF (xe )} (so we do not appeal to the Union Axiom here). If = O, then (|)  =O and ia)  “should be” the set of all sets, which does not exist. Finally, we set An = ()\ {,}, AU = \) {,}, and ANB = {xe :¢ }. The Replacement Scheme, like Comprehension, yields an infinite collec- tion of axioms—one for each ¢. The justification of Replacement is: assuming Vx €  ly (,), we can try to let = {:3xeA (, )};  should be small enough to exist as  set, since its cardinality is < that of the set . Of course, by Replacement (and Comprehension), {:dxe  6(, )} does exist, since it is also {ye :3xeA (, )} for any  such that Vxe  aye  (, ). For any  and , we define the cartesian product Ax = {<,>:xEA  yeBh. To justify this definition, we must apply Replacement twice. First, for any €. we have Vxe  !( = (,), so by Replacement (and Comprehension) we may define prod(, ) = {:3xe ( = <, ))}. Now, Vye B4!lz( = prod(, )), so by Replacement we may define prod’(, ) = {prod(, ):  € }. Finally, we define    = () prod’(, ). We now review some other notions which may be developed on the basis of the Axioms O, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  relation is  set  all of whose elements are ordered pairs. dom() = {:Jy(<,> €)}
