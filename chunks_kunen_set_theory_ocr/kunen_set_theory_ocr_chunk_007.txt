=== 第14页 === xvi Introduction Axiom 9. Choice ( §6). VAR ( well-orders ). ZFC is the system of Axioms O-9. For technical reasons, it will sometimes be important to know that some of the results which we prove from ZFC do not in fact require all the axioms of ZFC; the reason for this is discussed at the end of  §4. We list here some abbreviations for commonly used subtheories of ZFC. ZF consists of Axioms O-8, ZF —  consists of Axioms O-7, and ZFC —  consists of Axioms O-7 plus Axiom 9. By ZFC”, ZF~, ZF~ — , and ZFC” — , we mean the respective theory (ZFC, ZF, ZF — ,and ZFC — ) with Axiom 2 (Foundation) deleted. Other abbreviations for weakenings of ZFC are usually self-explanatory. For example, ZF~ —  — Inf is ZF~ —  with the Axiom of Infinity deleted.

=== 第15页 === CHAPTER  THE FOUNDATIONS OF SET THEORY It is assumed that the reader has seen  development of mathematics based on some principles roughly resembling the axioms listed in §7 of the Introduction. In this chapter we review such  development, stressing some foundational points which will be important for later work. §1. Why axioms? Most mathematicians have little need for  precise codification of the set theory they use. It is generally understood which principles are correct beyond any doubt, and which are subject to question. For example, it is generally agreed that the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is not  basic prin- ciple, but rather an open conjecture, and we are all able, without the benefit of any formal axiomatization, to tell which of our theorems we have proved absolutely and which depend upon the (as yet undecided) truth or falsity of CH. However, in this book we are concemed with establishing results like: “CH is neither provable nor refutable from ordinary set-theoretic prin- ciples”, In order to make that statement precise, we must say exactly what those principles are; in this book, we have defined them to be the axioms of ZFC listed in the Introduction. The assertion: “CH is neither provable nor refutable from ZFC” is now  well-defined statement which we shall establish in Chapters VI and VII. The question remains as to whether the axioms of ZFC do embody all the “ordinary set-theoretic principles”. In this chapter we shall develop them far enough to be able to see how one can derive from them all of current conventional mathematics. Of course, future generations of mathematicians may come to realize some “obviously true” set-theoretic principles which do not follow from ZFC. Conceivably, CH could be then settled using those principles. Even at the present, there are several ways besides ZFC for handling the axiomatization of currently accepted set-theoretic principles (see §12). The 1
