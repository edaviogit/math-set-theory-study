=== 第9页 === INTRODUCTION Set theory is the foundation of mathematics. All mathematical concepts are defined in terms of the primitive notions of set and membership. In axiomatic set theory we formulate  few simple axioms about these primitive notions in an attempt to capture the basic “obviously true” set-theoretic principles. From such axioms, all known mathematics may be derived. However, there are some questions which the axioms fail to settle, and that failure is the subject of this book. §1. Consistency results The specific axiom system we discuss is ZFC, or Zermelo—Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice. We say that  statement ¢ is independent of ZFC if neither @ nor 7@ (the negation of ¢) is provable from ZFC; this is equivalent to saying that both ZFC + 1@ and ZFC + ¢ are con- sistent. The most famous example of such  @ is the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), but within the past few years,  large number of statements, coming from various branches of mathematics, have been shown to be independent of ZFC. In this book, we study the techniques for showing that  statement ¢ is consistent with ZFC. @ will be shown to be independent if we can success- fully apply these techniques to @ and to 4; this will always involve two separate arguments. There are also many statements which have been shown to be consistent but whose independence has remained unsettled. Some of the statements known to be consistent with ZFC are “quotable” principles of abstract set theory, such as CH, or CH, or Martin’ Axiom, or Suslin’ Hypothesis, or ©. Workers in the more abstract areas of analysis and topology are well aware of these principles and often apply them. Since any consequence of  consistent statement is also consistent, this provides  source for many consistency proofs in mathematics. In addition, those mathematicians with  background in set theory often retum to the basic methods to prove consistency results for specific mathematical statements which do not follow from one of the known “quotable” principles. xi
