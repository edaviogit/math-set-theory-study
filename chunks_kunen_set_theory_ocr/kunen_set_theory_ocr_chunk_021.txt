Formally, the notion of “finite” has not yet been defined; it will be defined, by using the concept of “natural num- ber,” in §1O. Many mathematical arguments involve operations with the set of natural numbers, but one cannot prove on the basis of the axioms so far presented that there is such  set (see IV 3.12). We thus need  new axiom: Axio 7. Infinity. 3x(Oex » Vyex((yex).  If  satisfies the Axiom of Infinity, then “by induction”,  contains all natural numbers. More rigorously, suppose  is  natural number and néx. #O, so  = () for some ; then  <,  is  natural number and ¢ ; son  #O. Let ’ be the least element of — ; but applying the above argument to ’ produces an ’ < ’ with ’ ¢ , which is  contra- diction. Now, by Comprehension, there is  set of natural numbers. The usual principle of induction (7.16 (4)) is stated in terms of this set, and in the future will replace awkward arguments in the style of the previous paragraph. 7.15. DEFINITION. @ is the set of natural numbers. O  is an ordinal (by Lemma 7.5) and all smaller ordinals (.., all its ele- ments) are successor ordinals or O. So  is  limit ordinal (since if not it would be  natural number), and hence is the least limit ordinal. Actually, the Axiom of Infinity is equivalent to postulating the existence of  limit ordinal, since any limit ordinal satisfies the axiom. It is  philosophical quibble whether the elements of  are the real natural numbers (whatever that means). The important thing is that they satisfy the Peano Postulates, namely 7.16. THEOREM.

Given the natural numbers with the Peano Postulates, one may temporari- ly forget about ordinals and proceed to develop elementary mathematics

=== 第34页 === 2O The foundations of set theory {Ch. 1. §7 directly, constructing the integers and the rationals, and then introducing the Power Set Axiom and constructing the set of real numbers. The first step would be to define + and - on . We do not take this approach here, since we wish to discuss + and - on all ordinals. The approach we take actually defines + and - without using the Axiom of Infinity, although this fact is not of great importance here. To define +, note that 2+ 3 = 5 means that if  lay out 2 apples in  row followed by 3 bananas,  will have  row of 5 pieces of fruit. We thus define  +  as follows. 7.17.

O + is not commutative. For example | + @=oO4@ +1. + is com- mutative on the natural numbers (see § 1O). We compute +  by counting out « apples  times. Thus, for example, @-2=oO+O. 7.19.
