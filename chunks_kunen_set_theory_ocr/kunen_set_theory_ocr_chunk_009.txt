=== 第17页 === Ch. 1, §2) Why formal logic? 3 ,; for each natural number . Intuitively, ~ means “and,” 7 means “not,”  means “there exists,” € denotes membership, = denotes equality, vp, O1, ... are variables, and the parentheses are used for phrasing. An expression is any finite sequence of basic symbols, such as )33-). The intuitive interpreta- tion of the symbols indicates which expressions are meaningful; these are called formulas. More precisely, we define  formula to be any expression constructed by the rules: (1) ,€O;, ; = ; are formulas for any , . (2) If @ and are formulas, so are () (), 3(@), and 4v,(@) for any . So, for example, 39 (3, ((vp € O4)  (, €9))) is  formula. Our formal definition departs somewhat from intuition in that, in an effort to make the definition simple, the use of parentheses was prescribed very restrictively. For example, Up EV,  (Vy  LQ) is not  formula. Another seeming drawback of our formal language is that it seems to lack the ability to express certain very basic logical notions, like, ..  (for all). However, this is not really  problem, since 7 (3v;,(—1(¢))) expresses Vv;(). Similar remarks hold for  (or), + (implies) and + (iff), which may all be expressed using ~ and 7. To save ourselves the work of always writing these longer expressions, we agree at the outset to use the following abbreviations. (1) Wv,(@) abbreviates 7 (3v;(—1(¢))). (2) ()  (WW) abbreviates = (((4)) 4 (2 ())). (3) () + () abbreviates ((4))  (). 4) (#) + () abbreviates ((4) > ()) » (() > ())- (5) Parentheses are dropped if it is clear from the context how to put them in. (6) ; # vj abbreviates 4 (; = ,) and ; ¢ ; abbreviates 4 (; € ;). (7) Other letters and subscripted letters from the English, Greek, and Hebrew alphabet are used for variables. We shall explain (7) in more detail later. There are many abbreviations other than these seven. Actually, in this book we shall very rarely see  formula. We shall follow standard mathe- matical usage of writing expressions mostly in English, augmented by logical symbols when this seems useful. For example, we might say “there are sets , ,  such that xey ~ yez”, rather than Bo (3O; (BO2 ((v9 € v1)  (v1 €v2))))- The Comprehension Axiom (see Reason (1) above) will be made into  precise statement by requiring that properties () occurring in it be ex- pressible in the formal language, but it will not be necessary to write out the formula expressing () each time the Comprehension Axiom is used.
