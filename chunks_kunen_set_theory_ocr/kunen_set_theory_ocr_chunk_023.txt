Remarks on defined notions In the previous few sections, we have introduced  large number of set- theoretic definitions, starting with O and  in §5. We now address the ques- tion of whether our handling of these is justified. From  Platonistic point of view, this question might seem to be  mere quibble, since it is standard mathematical practice to enlarge one’ vocabu- lary as one introduces new concepts. However, in our axiomatic treatment, we explicitly stated our Comprehension and Replacement Axioms to apply only with properties expressible in the original vocabulary as defined in §2. Yet, we have frequently quoted these axioms with properties defined using new vocabulary. It would thus appear that we need our language and axioms to be elastic, and to expand with time, although such an approach seems highly inelegant. To avoid this difficulty, we take the official position that our formal language never changes, and that any new symbols introduced merely represent new ways of abbreviating formulas. The reason for these new abbreviations is the same as that for using Vx to abbreviate 74x: to save space and promote clarity. It is important to note that the properties we express with these new symbols can, if need be, be expressed without them, so that our original Comprehension and Replacement Axioms apply. To elaborate on this further, there are two kinds of defined notions: defined relations and defined operations. When we introduce  defined relation between objects, we are merely defining  way of abbreviating  formula using  new symbol. For example,    abbreviates Vz( ex > ze ). The “new symbol” may be  fragment of English; “ is empty” abbreviates Vz ( ¢ ). The introduction of defined operations (..,  , {}, + ) or con- stants (.., O, «) is slightly more tricky, since this can be done only when our axiom system can prove that the definition makes sense. More formally, if @(,, ..., Xp, ) is  formula with no variables except ,, ...,,,  free, and  is  set of axioms such that SE WX, Wy TY OO1, Xa Wy then we may, when arguing from , “define” (,, ...,,) to be the  such
