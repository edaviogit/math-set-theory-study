CH could be then settled using those principles. Even at the present, there are several ways besides ZFC for handling the axiomatization of currently accepted set-theoretic principles (see §12). The 1

Why formal logic? The idea of setting down one’ axioms harks back to Euclid, and is hardly revolutionary. Usually in mathematics the axioms are stated in an informal language, such as Greek or English. But here we shall state our axioms in  formal, or artificial, language, called the first-order predicate calculus. The feature of  formal language is that there are precise rules of formation for linguistic objects. There are two main reasons for this approach. Reason 1. Formal logic is needed to state the axioms of set theory precisely. For example, ZFC has  Comprehension Axiom asserting that sets of the form {xe : ()} exist, where  is  given set and () is any property of . But what is  property? Intuitively, it is any well-defined English assertion about the variable . Is “ is happy”  property? It is clear that we need  rigorous definition of which properties we are to admit. We shall require that () be expressible in our formal language, which will be capable of expressing mathematical notions, but not non-mathematical ones. The fact that an imprecise notion of property can lead to trouble is illustrated by the follow- ing “paradox” in ordinary reasoning: Let  be the least positive integer not definable by an English expression using forty words or less. But  have just defined it in forty words or less. Reason 2. Even after we have defined ZFC, what does it mean to say that CH is not provable from ZFC? Intuitively, it means that there is no way of deriving CH from ZFC using legitimate rules of inference. This intuitive notion can be made precise using the concept of  formal deduction. We shall only sketch here the development of formal logic, referring the reader to  text on the subject, such as [Enderton 1972], [Kleene 1952], or [Shoenfield 1967], for  more detailed treatment. We shall give  precise definition of the formal language, as this is easy to do and is necessary for stating the axioms of ZFC. We shall only hint at the rules of formal deduc- tion; these are also not hard to define, but it then takes some work to see that the standard mathematical arguments can all be formalized within the prescribed rules. The basic symbols of our formal language are ~, 7, , (,), €&, =, and™
