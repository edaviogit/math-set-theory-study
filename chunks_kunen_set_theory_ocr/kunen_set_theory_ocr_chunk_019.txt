development of set theory does not need AC, so in this chapter we shall explicitly indicate which re- sults have used AC in their proofs. AC is not provable in ZF; see [Jech 1973], or VII Exercise E3.

=== 第3O页 === 16 The foundations of set theory (Ch. 1, §7 §7. Ordinals The basics of the von Neumann theory of ordinals can be developed using the axioms so far presented, but at some point an axiom postulating the existence of  limit ordinal must be introduced. 7.1. DEFINITION.  set  is transitive iff every element of  is  subset ofx.  In 6 we tried to use different type for different “kinds” of sets, , ,... for elements, , ,... for sets, and  for families of sets. But in the light of Definition 7.1, it is impossible to maintain this distinction. Examples of transitive sets are O, {O}, {O, {O}, and {{ {O}}, {O},O}}. {{O}} is not transitive. If  = {}, then  is transitive; for more on such pathological sets see III. 7.2. DEFINITION.  is an ordinal iff  is transitive and well-ordered by «. O More formally, the assertion that  is well-ordered by € means that <, €,> is  well-ordering, where €, = {<,>   :  ez}. Examples of ordinals are O, {O}, {O, {O}}, whereas { { {O}}, {O}, O} is not an ordinal. If  = {}, then  is not ordinal since we have defined orderings to be strict. We shall often drop explicit mention of €, in discussing an ordinal . Thus, we write  = <, ) for (, €,> = (, ) and, when ye , pred(, ) for pred(, , €,). 7.3. THEOREM. (1) If  is an ordinal and  € , then  is an ordinal and  = pred (, ). (2) If  and  are ordinals and  = , then  = . (3) If  and  are ordinals, then exactly one of the following is true:  = , xEy,yex. (4) If , , and  are ordinals,  ey, and ye , then  ez. (5) If  is  non-empty set of ordinals, then 3xeCVyeC(xey vx =). Proor. For (3), use (1), (2) and Theorem 6.3 to show that at least one of of the three conditions holds. That no more than one holds follows from the fact that no ordinal can be  member of itself, since  €  would imply that (,€,) is not  (strict) total ordering (since  €, ). For (5), note that the conclusion is, by (3), equivalent to 3xe (   = O). Let xeC be arbitrary. If  ©  + O, then, since  is well-ordered by , there is an €least element,  ofx 9 ;thenx OC =O. O
