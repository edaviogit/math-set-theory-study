If  is any set of sentences and ¢ is  sentence, then $+ ¢ means intuitively that @ is provable from  by  purely logical argument that may quote sentences in § as axioms but may not refer to the intended “meaning” of €. Formally, we define  + @ iff there is  formal deduction of ¢ from ; this is  finite sequence ,,...,, of formulas such that ¢, is ¢ and for each , either @; is in  or ¢; is  logical axiom or ¢; follows from @,,...,@;-1 by certain rules of inference. Notions such as “logical axiom” and “rule of inference” are defined purely syntactically. If St @ where  is the empty set of sentences, we write | @ and say that ¢ is logically valid. If (@ + ), we say ¢ and yw are logically equivalent. We do not dwell here on the precise definition of +, but merely remark on some of its properties. See §4 for further discussion. If @ is  formula,  universal closure of ¢ is  sentence obtained by uni- versally quantifying all free variables of @. For example, if ¢ is  =yVz(zEexerzey), then Vx Vy @ and Vy Vx ¢ are universal closures of ¢. All universal closures of  formula are logically equivalent. In common parlance, when one asserts @, One means to assert its universal closure. Formally, if  is  set of sen- tences and @ is  formula, we define  + ¢ to mean that the universal closure of ¢ is derivable from . The meaning of + @ when elements of  are not sentences is not the same in all presentations of logic and will not be dis- cussed here. We extend to formulas our notions of logical validity and logical equiva- lence. Thus, we call ¢ logically valid iff its universal closure is logically valid; and we say ¢ and  are logically equivalent iff ¢ +  is logically valid. Using the notion of logical equivalence, we may make precise the idea that bound variables are dummy variables. If @(,,...,,) is  formula with only ,,...,, free and $’(;, ...,,) results from replacing the bound variables of @ with other variables, then @ and ¢’ are logically equivalent. This enables us to be sloppy in our use of the various English, Greek, and Hebrew letters to stand for the official variables vo, ;, v2, .... For example, we have stated the Pairing Axiom as Vx Vy dz(xez  yez). Formally, we should have chosen some distinct , ,  and written the axiom as Wo, Wo, Avy (; € v_  Vj € Vy). However, all such choices of , ,  yield logically equivalent axioms. Likewise, when we use other abbreviations, we can be vague about which
