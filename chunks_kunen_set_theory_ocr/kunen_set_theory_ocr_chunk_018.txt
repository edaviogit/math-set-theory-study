() prod’(, ). We now review some other notions which may be developed on the basis of the Axioms O, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  relation is  set  all of whose elements are ordered pairs. dom() = {:Jy(<,> €)}

These definitions make sense for any set , but are usually used only when  is  relation, in which case   dom()  ran(). We define R7! = {<,>:<, ) ER}, so (R7')"! = Rif  isa relation.  is  function iff  is  relation and Vx edom() 3! eran()(<, > ef). :—  means  is  function,  = dom(), and ran()  .

Many people use () for ”, but the notation would cause confusion in this book since often elements of  will be subsets of  as well. :— Bis 1-1, or an injection, iff ~1 is  function, and  is onto, or  surjection, iff ran() = .  :  + Bisa bijection iff  is both 1-1 and onto.  total ordering (sometimes called  strict total ordering) is  pair <, > such that  totally orders  —that is,  is  set,  is  relation,  is transitive on : Vx, ,€(xRy  yRz — xRz), trichotomy holds: vx, ye ( =   xRy  yRx), and  is irreflexive: Vx € (71(xRx)). As usual, we write xRy for (,) €. Note that our definition does nov assume     , 58O if (, ) is  total ordering so is ¢ ,  whenever BcA, Whenever  and  are relations, and , Bare sets, we say (, > = ¢,) iff there is  bijection :  —  such that Vx, ye (xRy () Sf()).  is called an isomorphism from ¢ , ) to ¢, ). We say  well-orders , or <, ) is  well-ordering iff ¢ , ) is  total ordering and every non-O subset of  has an -least element. If xe , let pred(, , ) = {ye : yRx}. This notation is used mainly when dealing with ordering. The basic rigidity properties of well-ordering are given as follows. 6.1. Lemma. If (,) is @ well-ordering, then for all xe , <,) ¥ <pred(, , ), >.

If (,) and ¢,) are isomorphic well-orderings, then the isomorphism between them is unique. Proor. If  and  were different isomorphisms, derive  contradiction by considering the -least ye  such that () # ().  The proofs of Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2 are examples of proofs by transfinite induction.  basic fact about well-orderings is that any two are comparable: 6.3. THeorEM. Let (, ), <,> be two well-orderings. Then exactly one of the following holds: () (, > = ¢,); () dye (¢ , RY = Cpred(, , ), >); () axe (<pred(, , ), > = <,>). Proor. Let ={<,):vEeA AweB <pred(, , ),> = <pred(, , ),>}; note that  is an isomorphism from some initial segment of  onto some initial segment of , and that these initial segments cannot both be proper. O The notion of well-ordering gives us  convenient way of stating the Axiom of Choice (AC). Axiom 9. Choice. VA IR ( well-orders ). oO There are many equivalent versions of AC. See, .., [Jech 1973], [Rubin— Rubin 1963], or Exercises 9—11. This book is concemed mainly with set theory with AC. However, it is of some interest that much of the elementary development of set theory does not need AC, so in this chapter we shall explicitly indicate which re- sults have used AC in their proofs. AC is not provable in ZF; see [Jech 1973], or VII Exercise E3.
