The distrib- utive law, (6), fails for multiplication on the right, since (1 + 1)-@ = @ #1-@ + 1-. On the natural numbers, - is commutative (see §1O). Natural numbers give us  way of handling finite sequences. 7.21. DEFINITION. () ” is the set of functions from  into . () As? = ( {": neo}.  Under this definition, ? and    are not the same, but there is an obvious 1-1 correspondence between them. It is not completely trivial to prove that Definition 7.21 makes sense without using the Power Set Axiom (to be introduced in §1O). Let 6(, ) say that Vs (€ «+ isa function from  into ). By induction on  (ie., by Peano Postulate 7.16 (4)), show Vn ew Jy $(, ); the induction step uses Replacement plus the identification of "*! with "  . By Extensionality, Vn €  3! $(, ), so by Replacement we may form {: dn ew (, )} = {":ne@}, whence by the Union Axiom, *° exists. We often think that of the elements of ” as the sequences from  of length . 7.22. DEFINITION. For each , (Xo, ..., ,—1> is the function  with domain  such that (O) = Xo, (1) = X1,...,(7 - 1) = ,-,.  In the case  = 2, this definition of <, > is inconsistent with the defini- tion of ordered pair in §6. The more elementary definition, (,) = {{}, {, }} is convenient while developing basic properties of functions and relations, while Definition 7.22 becomes more useful when we wish to handle finite sequences of various finite lengths. In those few cases when it makes  difference which definition of <, > is intended, we shall say so explicitly. In general, if  is  function with dom() = , we may think of  as an index set and  as  sequence indexed by . In this case, we often write 5; for (). Variants of Definition 7.22 are then used to explicitly define such functions; for example, {  {}: ie ) is the function  with dom() =  and () =  {} for allie /. When dom() is an ordinal «, we may think of  as  sequence of length .
