=== 第11页 === Introduction xiii fairly pedantic about the fact that for many of the theorems, certain axioms, especially Choice and Power Set, are not needed, and we have indicated explicitly where these axioms are used; such considerations are not impor- tant for the development of mathematics within ZFC, but will be useful when we get to independence proofs. Chapter II covers some special topics in combinatorial set theory. In part, this chapter provides some combinatorial lemmas needed in Chapters VI-VIII, but its main purpose is to introduce the reader to the vast array of set-theoretic questions that one might try to prove independent of ZFC. We have departed from tradition in basing our treatment of forcing in Chapter VII upon the discussion of Martin’ Axiom in Chapter II. This has the advantage of separating the mathematical difficulties in handling forcing from the metamathematical ones. It has the disadvantage of re- quiring those readers (if there are any) who wish to leam forcing without leaming Martin’ Axiom to do some extra work. The Axiom of Foundation is discussed in Chapter III. This axiom is never used in mathematics, but it leads to  much clearer picture of the set theoretic universe. Chapter IV develops the basic methods used in producing consistency proofs, including inner models, relativization, and absoluteness. We also discuss the Reflection Theorem and related results. Chapter  discusses the formalization of the logical notion of definability within ZFC. These ideas are used in defining the class  of constructible sets in Chapter VI. In Chapter VI we establish the consistency of the Gener- alized Continuum Hypothesis by showing that it holds in . We also show that the combinatorial principles } and ©* are true in . Chapter VII introduces forcing and uses it to prove the consistency of CH and various related statements of cardinal arithmetic. Chapter VIII covers iterated forcing and the consistency of Martin’ Axiom with —CH. §4. How to use this book In intemal cross referencing, chapters are denoted by Roman numerals and § denotes section number. Thus, VII §5 is the fifth section of Chapter Seven, and VII 5.16 is the sixteenth numbered enunciation in that section. The exercises range from routine verifications to additional development of the material in the chapter. The more difficult ones are starred. The exercises are not necessary for understanding later material in the text, although they are sometimes required for later exercises. There are probably more exercises in some of the chapters than most readers will want to do. It is not necessary to read the book straight through from cover to cover. In particular, the material in Chapter II is not used at all until the end of
