(1)  is weakly inaccessible iff  is  regular limit car- dinal. (2) (AC)  is strongly inaccessible iff  > ,  is regular, and WA<(2i<).  So, strong inaccessibles are weak inaccessibles, and under GCH the no- tions coincide. It is consistent that 2° is weakly inaccessible or that it is larger than the first weak inaccessible (see VII 5.16). One cannot prove in ZFC that weak inaccessibles exist (see VI 4.13).  modification of Cantor’ diagonal argument yields that (O) > @- More generally, the following holds. 1O.4O. Lemma (AC). Konig.

Appendix 1: Other set theories We discuss briefly two other systems of set theory which differ from ZF in that they give classes  formal existence. In both, all sets are classes,.but not all classes are sets. Let us temporarily use capital letters to range over classes. We define  to be  set iff 3Y( ¢), and we use lower case letters to range sets. In both systems, the sets satisfy the usual ZF axioms, and the intersection of  class with  set is  set. The system NBG (von Neumann-Bemays-Gédel, see [Gédel 194O]) has as  class comprehension axiom, the universal closure of aX Vy(ye Xo 6()), where @ may have other free set and class variables, but the bound variables of @ may only range over sets. NBG is  conservative extension of ZF; that is, if  is  sentence with only set variables, NBGt  iff ZF +  (see [Wang 1949], [Shoenfield 1954]). Unlike ZF, NBG is finitely axiomatizable.
