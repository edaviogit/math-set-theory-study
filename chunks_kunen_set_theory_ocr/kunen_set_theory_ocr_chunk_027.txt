O : We remark that the principle of transfinite induction (Theorem 9.2) can be applied to prove results about cardinals, since every class of cardinals is  class of ordinals. This is illustrated by the following Theorem. 1O.12. THEOREM. Jf  is an infinite cardinal,  ®  = kK. Proor. By transfinite induction on . Assume this holds for smaller cardi- nals.
