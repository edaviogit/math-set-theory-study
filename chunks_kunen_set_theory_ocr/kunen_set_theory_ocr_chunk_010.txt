by requiring that properties () occurring in it be ex- pressible in the formal language, but it will not be necessary to write out the formula expressing () each time the Comprehension Axiom is used.

=== 第18页 === 4 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, §2  subformula of @ is  consecutive sequence of symbols of @ which form  formula. For example, the 5 subformulae of (3x (vo € v1)  (32 (v2 €»1)) ) ATE Vp EV}, Wo (Vp EV;), V2 € Vy, Vy (V2 €,), and the formula (1) itself. The scope of an occurrence of  quantifier jv; is the (unique) subformula be- ginning with that 3v,. For example, the scope of the Ivp in (1) is v9 (vp EY). An occurrence of  variable in  formula is called bound iff it lies in the scope ofa quantifier acting on that variable, otherwise it is called free. For example, in (1) the first occurrence of , is free, but the second is bound, whereas vg is bound at its occurrences and 1, is free at its occurrence. Intuitively,  formula expresses  property of its free variables, whereas the bound or dummy variables are used just to make existential statements which could be made equally well with different bound variables. Thus, formula (1) means the same as (Avg (4 € O1)  (vg (v2 € P4))- Note that since Vv; is an abbreviation for 7 3v;7, it also binds its variable ;, whereas the abbreviations , >, « are defined in terms of other pro- positional connections and do not bind variables. Often in  discussion, we present  formula and call it $(,,...,,) to emphasize its dependence on ,,...,,. Then, later, if ,,..., , are other variables, (;, ...,¥,) Will denote the formula resulting from substituting  ; for each free occurrence of ;. Such  substitution is called free, or legitimate iff no free occurrence of an ; is in the scope of  quantifier ;. The idea is that $(,,...,,) says about ,,...,, What (,,...,,) said about ,,...,,, but this will not be the case if the substitution is not free and some ; gets bound by  quantifier of ¢. In general, we shall always as- sume that our substitutions are free. The use of the notation $(,,...,,) does not imply that each ; actually occurs free in #(,,...,,); also, (x1, .--),) may have other free variables which in the particular dis- cussion we are not emphasizing. For example, let @(,, O3) be formula (1). Then $(v2, vg) is (2v (v9 € v2)  (3r1 (v2 € v1), and (vo, vs) is (v9 (9 € v9))  (Avs (v2 € v1). (2) But this latter substitution is not free, and has perverted the meaning of ¢. The assertion in (,, v3) that “, has an element” became “some set is an element of itself” in (vo, vg).  sentence is  formula with no free variables; intuitively, it states an
