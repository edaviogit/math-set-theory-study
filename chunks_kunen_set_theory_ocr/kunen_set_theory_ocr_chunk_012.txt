For example,  Aw Ax could abbreviate either 6  (  ) or (  )  , but since these two formulas are logically equivalent, it usually does not matter which of the two sentences we choose officially to represent @    . If  is  set of sentences,  is consistent (Con()) iff for no @ does St and $+ 7@. If  is inconsistent, then +  for all  and  is thus of no interest. By formalizing reductio ad absurdum, one proves for any sentence  that St @ iff   {9} is inconsistent and $+ @ iff   {dp} is in- consistent. Thus, ZFC / CH is equivalent to Con(ZFC + CH), (ie, Con(ZFC vu {CH})). Intuitively,  =  means that  and  are the same object. This is re- flected formally in the fact that basic properties of equality are logically valid and need not be stated explicitly as axioms of ZFC. For example, kx =>Vz(zEexerzey), whereas the converse is not logically valid, although it is  theorem of ZFC since its universal closure is an axiom (Extensionality): Vx Vy (Wz(zexazey)>=). The fact that formal deductions from  are finite objects means that they can only mention  finite number of sentences in  even if  infinite. Thus, the following theorem holds. 2.1. THEOREM. () If + @, then there is  finite Sy <  such that Sgt ¢. () If  is inconsistent, there is  finite Sy <  such that So is inconsistent. O This will be important since ZFC is an infinite set of axioms. §3. The philosophy of mathematics This section presents  caricature of some extremes of mathematical thought. For  more serious discussion, see [Fraenkel-Bar-Hillel-Lévy 1973], [Kleene 1952], or [Kreisel—Krivine 1967].  Platonist believes that the set-theoretic universe has an existence out- side of ourselves, so that CH is in fact either true or false (although at present we do not know which). From this point of view, the axioms of ZFC are merely certain obviously true set-theoretic principles. The fact that these axioms neither prove nor refute CH says nothing about its truth or falsity and does not preclude the possibility of our eventually being able to decide CH using some other obviously true principles which we forgot to list in ZFC. But  Platonist should still be interested in this independence result,
