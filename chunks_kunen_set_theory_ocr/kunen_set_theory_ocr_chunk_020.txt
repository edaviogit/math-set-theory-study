THEOREM. —132z Vx ( is an ordinal +  € ). Proor. If there were such   then we would have  set ON such that ON = {: xis an ordinal} . Then ON is transitive by (1) of Theorem 7.3 and well-ordered by € (by (3), (4), (5)), so ON is an ordinal, so ON € ON; but, as pointed out in the proof of Theorem 7.3, no ordinal is  member of itself. O This so-called Burali-Forti paradox indicates (as did the Russell paradox, Theorem 5.1) that one must exercise some care when forming the set of elements satisfying  given property. Any proper initial segment of the non-existent ON is an ordinal. 7.5. Lemma. If  is  set of ordinals and Vx €  Vy €  ( € ), then  is an ordinal. O 7.6. THEOREM. If <, ) is  well-ordering, then there is  unique ordinal  such that <, RD = . Proor. Uniqueness follows from Theorem 7.3 (2). To prove existence, let  = {ae : 3x( is an ordinal » (pred(,,),> = )}. Let  be the function with domain  such that for  , () = the (unique) ordinal  such that <pred(4, , ), ) = , and let  = ran(). Now check that  is an ordinal (using Lemma 7.5), that  is an isomorphism from ¢, ) onto , and that either  =  (in which case we are done), or = pred(, , ) for some be  (in which case we would have be  and hence acontradiction). O Note that the proof of Theorem 7.6 used the Axiom of Replacement in an essential way to justify the existence of the set . More formally, we let (, ) be the formula asserting <pred(, , ), > = . Then Vac  3! @(, ), so by Replacement (and Comprehension) one can form  = {:JaeB (,)}, and then use Comprehension to define < Bx . If one drops Replacement from ZFC, one can still develop most of “ordinary” mathematics, but one cannot prove Theorem 7.6; see IV Exercise 9 for more details.

If (, ) is  well-ordering, type(, ) is the unique ordinal  such that¢4,>) =.  From now on we use Greek letters , , , ... to vary over ordinals. We may thus say, .., Vo --- instead of Vx ( is an ordinal > ---). Since € orders the ordinals, we write « <  for «€  and use the standard conventions with order;.., =>  means Bea   =. 7.8.

(2) If  is  set of ordinals, sup() is the least ordinal = all elements of , and, if  # O, min() is the least ordinal in .  The first few ordinals are the natural numbers. We use natural numbers to count finite sets. The importance of ordinals in set theory is that, assuming AC, every set can be counted by an ordinal (see §1O). Many of the standard arithmetic operations on natural numbers can be defined on all the ordinals. We begin with successor. 7.1O. DEFINITION. () =  {}.  7.11. Lemma. For any , () is an ordinal,  < (), and VB( < () <).O 7.12. DEFINITION. « is  successor ordinal iff 3B ( = ()). « is  limit ordinal iff « #O and  is not  successor ordinal.  7.13.

DEFINITION. « is  natural number iff VB < ( = O   is  succes- sor ordinal).  It is immediate from the definition that the natural numbers form an initial segment of the ordinals. Intuitively, they are those ordinals obtained by applying  to O  finite number of times, since if  is the least ordinal not
