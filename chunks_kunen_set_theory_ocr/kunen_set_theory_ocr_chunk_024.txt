The introduction of constants is the special case when  = O. For example, let $(, , ) be Vo(ve zo vex Avey). If  contains the instance of the Comprehension Axiom used to prove that Vx Vy 3!

Thus, {: (, ;,..., ¥,)} is the unique  such that Wx ( 2 ( Vrs +5 In)» This notation is only used when  contains Extensionality and SEW, 2O5 Vy 32 VX (XE 2 (% V5 Os Yad) We consider partially defined operations (¢.., « + ), to be defined to be O outside their natural domains. So,  +  is defined for all ,  and is O unless  and  are both ordinals. We refer the reader to §13 for  more formal treatment of defined symbols. §9. Classes and recursion We have seen that there need not exist  set of the form {: ()}; the simplest example being {: = }. There is nothing wrong with thinking about such collections, and they sometimes provide useful motivation; but since they are outside the domain of discourse described by the axioms, they must never appear in  formal proof. See § 12 for remarks on set theories in which such collections do appear formally. Informally, we call any collection of the form {: @()}  class. We allow ¢ to have free variables other than , which are thought of as parameters upon which the class depends.  proper class is  class which does not form  set (because it is “too big”). The Comprehension Axiom says that any subclass of  set is  set. We use boldface letters to denote classes. Two use- ful classes, which are proper by Theorems 5.2 and 7.4, are given by the following.
