possibility of our eventually being able to decide CH using some other obviously true principles which we forgot to list in ZFC. But  Platonist should still be interested in this independence result,

Finitist believes only in finite objects; one is not justified in forming the set of rational numbers, let alone the set of real numbers, so CH is  meaning- less statement. There is some merit in the Finitist’ position, since all ob- jects in known physical reality are finite, so that infinite sets may be discarded as figments of the mathematician’ imagination. Unfortunately, this point of view also discards much of modem mathematics. The Formalist can hedge his bets. The formal development of ZFC makes sense from  strictly finitistic point of view: the axioms of ZFC do not say anything, but are merely certain finite sequences of symbols. The assertion ZFC + @ means that there is  certain kind of finite sequence of finite sequences of symbols—namely,  formal proof of @. Even though ZFC contains infinitely many axioms, notions like ZFC+ @ will make sense, since one can recognize when  particular sentence is an axiom of ZFC.  Formalist can thus do his mathematics just like  Platonist, but if challenged about the validity of handling infinite objects, he can reply that all he is really doing is juggling finite sequences of symbols. Pedagogically, it is much easier to develop ZFC from  platonistic point of view, and we shall do so throughout this book. Thus, to establish that ZFC + @, we shall simply produce an argument that ¢ is true based on the assumption that the axioms of ZFC are true. Those readers who are For- malists and are skilled in formal logic will then see how to produce  formal proof of @ from ZFC. In some cases, when the formalistic interpretation of the material in  chapter is not immediately apparent, we have elaborated on this in an appendix to the chapter. It is important to make  distinction between the formal theory and the metatheory. If we are discussing ZFC, then the formal theory is ZFC, and  formal theorem is  sentence in the formal language provable from ZFC. If we announce, in our development of the formal theory: 3.1. THEorEM. There are uncountably many real numbers. O Then we mean that the sentence of the formal language which expresses Theorem 3.1 is  formal theorem of ZFC. The metatheory consists of what is really true. This distinction is some- what easier for the Finitist to make, since he must view the metatheory as being strictly finitistic. An example of  result in the metatheory is Con(ZFC) + Con(ZFC + CH). This is  statement about the formal theories which we shall establish in
