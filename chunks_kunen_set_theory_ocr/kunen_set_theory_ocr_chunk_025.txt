. The Comprehension Axiom says that any subclass of  set is  set. We use boldface letters to denote classes. Two use- ful classes, which are proper by Theorems 5.2 and 7.4, are given by the following.

Formally, proper classes do not exist, and expressions involving them must be thought of as abbreviations for expressions not involving them. Thus,  ¢ ON abbreviates the formula expressing that  is an ordinal, and ON =  abbreviates the (false) sentence (abbreviated by) Vx ( is an ordinal +  = ). There is, in fact, no formal distinction between  formula and  class; the distinction is only in the informal presentation. We could think of 9.1 as defining ON() to abbreviate the formula “ is an ordinal,” but it is useful to think of ON as  class if we wish to write expressions like ON 1  (to abbreviate { € :  is an ordinal}). Any of our defined predicates and functions might be thought of as  class. For example, we could think of the union operation as defining  class UN = {<<,),): = Uy}. Intuitively, UN:    > , and this motivates using an abbreviation like UN} (  6) for {xy 2:2 = Uy  xea  yeb} The abbreviations obtained with the class become very useful when dis- cussing general properties of classes. Asserting that  statement is true of all classes is equivalent to asserting  theorem schema. As an example of this, we state the principles of induction and recursion on ON. 9.2. THEOREM. Transfinite Induction on ON. If  < ON and  # O then  has  least element. Proor. Exactly like Theorem 7.3(5), which asserted the same thing when  isa set. Fix «€. If «is not the least element of , let  be the least ele- ment of « © . Then  is the least element of . O Mathematically, Theorems 7.3 (5) and 9.2 are very similar. But formally there is  great difference. Theorem 7.3 (5) is an abbreviation for one sen- tence which is provable, whereas 9.2 is  theorem schema, which represents an infinite collection of theorems. To state Theorem 9.2 without classes, we would have to say: for each formula (, ,,...,,), the following is  theorem: V2, ..-,2n { [Vx ( >  isan ordinal) , 3x ] > = [3x(  (CO,21,-.,2) 7 =].

=== 第39页 === Ch. 1, §9) Classes and recursion 25 Note that here we are thinking of  as defining {: (, 2,,...,2,)}, with Z4,..-,, aS parameters. The fact that we may use parameters in the definition of classes implies that  schema such as 9.2 about all classes has, as one special case, the universal statement about all sets. Thus, if (, ) is  € , then (1) is equiva- lent to Vz {[ isa non-O set of ordinals] + [3x €zVyez( = )]}, which is Theorem 7.3 (5).  “proof by transfinite induction on ” establishes Va () by showing, for each , that (VB <  ()) > Ya. Then Va () follows, since Ja —(), the least « such that 7y() would lead to  contradiction.  similar result says that one can define  function of « recursively from information about the function below «. 9.3. THEOREM. Transfinite Recursion on ON. If :  > , then there is  unique : ON >  such that Va [() = (Gf )]. ) Proor. For uniqueness, if , and , both satisfied (2), one proves Va (,() = ,()) by transfinite induction on «. To establish existence, call   6-approximation iff  is  function with domain 6 and Va < 6 [() = (gf «)]. As in the uniqueness proof, if  is  6-approximation and ’ is  6’-approxi- mation, then gf (5 9 6’) = gf (6 16’). Next, by transfinite induction on 6, show that for each 6 there is  6-approximation (which is then unique). Now, define () to be the value (), where  is the 6-approximation for some(any) >  Theorem 9.3 may be stated more verbosely without using classes. Given  formula (, ) (with possibly other free variables), one can explicitly define  formula (, ) (the way  was defined above) so that Vx 3! (, ) + [Va 3!
