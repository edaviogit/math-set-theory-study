) = {:zc }.  This definition is justified by the Power Set and Comprehension Axioms. The operation gives us  way of constructing sets of larger and larger cardinalities. 1O.15. THEOREM. Cantor.  < ().

Many of the basic properties of cardinals need AC. See [Jech 1973] for  discussion of what can happen if AC is dropped. 1O.2O. LemMa (AC). If there is  function  from  onto ¥, then || < ||. Proor. Let  well-order , and define :   so that () is the -least element of ~1({}). Then  is 1-1,so YX .  As in Theorem 1O.16, one can prove without AC that there is  map from PA() onto ,, but one cannot produce  1-1 map from @, into (). 1O.21. Lemma (AC). If  > and |,| $ for all «<, then || Jaen Xq| Sx.

Lévy showed that is consistent with ZF that () and , are countable unions of countable sets.

DeFinition. An -ary function on  is an : " >  ifn > O, or an element of  if  = O. If Bc , Bis closed under  iff ’" <  (or feB when  = O).  finitary function is an -ary function for some . If ¥ is  set of finitary functions and   , the closure of  under # is the least Cc  such that    and  is closed under all the functions in .  Note that there isa least ,namely () {: Bc Dc  Disclosed under }. 1O.23. THEOREM (AC). Let  be an infinite cardinal. Suppose  < , || < , and ¥ isa set of < finitary functions on . Then the closure of  under  has cardinality <. Proor. If fe ¥ and  , let *  be ”(") if  is -place, or { } if fis -place. Note that || < —>|*| <. Let Cy= and ,4, = , UU {* ,: fe }. By Lemma 1O.21 and induction on , |,| <  for all . Let , = , ,. Then ,, is the closure of  under ¥ and, by 1O.21 again, |,| <.   simple illustration of Theorem 1O.23 is the fact that every infinite group, , has  countably infinite subgroup. To see this, let  <  be arbitrary such that || = «, and apply 1O.23 with ¥ consisting of the 2-ary group multiplication and the !-ary group inverse. Our intended application of 1O.23 is not with groups, but with models of set theory. We tum now to cardinal exponentiation. 1O.24. Derinition. ? = " ={: is  function » dom()=  ran()¢ 4}.  ® < PB  ), so ® exists by the Power Set Axiom. 1O.25. Derinition (AC). «* The notations * and * are both common in the literature. When dis- cussing cardinal exponentiation, one can avoid confusion by using * for the cardinal and “ for the set of functions.
