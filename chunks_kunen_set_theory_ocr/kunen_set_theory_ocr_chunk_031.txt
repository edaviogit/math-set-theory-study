ange over sets. NBG is  conservative extension of ZF; that is, if  is  sentence with only set variables, NBGt  iff ZF +  (see [Wang 1949], [Shoenfield 1954]). Unlike ZF, NBG is finitely axiomatizable.

=== 第5O页 === 36 The foundations of set theory [Ch. 1, §13 The system MK (Morse-Kelley; see the Appendix of [Kelley 1955]) strengthens NBG by allowing an arbitrary ¢ to appear in the class compre- hension axiom. MK is not  conservative extension of ZF and is not finitely axiomatizable (see Exercises 25, 26). None of the three theories, ZF, NBG, and MK, can claim to be the “right” one. ZF seems inelegant, since it forces us to treat classes, as we did in §9, via  circumlocution in the metatheory. Once we give classes  formal existence, it is hard to justify the restriction in NBG on the @ occurring in the class comprehension axiom, so MK seems like the right theory. How- ever, once we have decided to give classes their full rights, it is natural to consider various properties of classes, and to try to form super-classes, such as {RC ON  ON:  well-orders ON}. In MK, such objects can be handled only via an inelegant circumlocution in the metatheory. ZF, NBG, and MK are all founded on the same basic concepts, and the proofs in this book for ZF are easily adapted to the other two theories, although ZF is technically slightly easier to deal with.  set theory which is different in principle from ZF is Quine’ New Foundations, NF, see [Quine 1937], [Quine 1951], and [Rosser 1953]. Like ZF, NF has only sets, but  universal set exists: Jv Vx ( €). Unlike ZF, NF makes the restriction on forming {: 6()} not one of size, but of the syntactical form of @; @ must be stratified, which means roughly that it can be obtained from  formula of type theory by erasing the types.  =  is stratified, but  ex and ¢ are not, so one avoids Russell’ paradox. It is unknown whether NF is consistent, even assuming Con(ZF). It is known that NF + 4AC [Specker 1953]. NF is usually rejected as  foundation of mathematics for this reason and because we do not have  “clear” picture of the objects it describes as we get with ZF using Foundation (see III). The reader is referred ‘to [Fraenkel-Bar-Hillel-Lévy 1973] for  more detailed discussion of the various axiomatizations of set theory. §13. Appendix 2: Eliminating defined notions One aspect of our development of ZF which seems to be lacking in rigor is our treatment in §8 of defined notions. This is usually handled by the following general discussion in the metatheory. We specify  formal language by defining its set, , of non-logical symbols;  symbol of # may be an -place predicate symbol or an -place function symbol for some finite ; O-place function symbols are called constant symbols. = is considered  logical symbol, so for the language of set theory,  = {}.
