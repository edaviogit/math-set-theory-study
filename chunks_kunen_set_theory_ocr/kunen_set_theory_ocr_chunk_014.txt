The distinction between formal theory and metatheory is  little trickier for  Platonist. The Finitist can interpret Theorem 3.1 only as  formal theorem, since it talks about infinite objects and is therefore not really meaningful. To the Platonist, Theorem 3.1 also represents  true statement about the real world, but the fact that it is also  formal theorem means that it can be established on the basis of ZFC only. The Platonists of 21OO may know whether CH is true, but neither CH nor “CH will ever be  formal theorem of ZFC. Likewise, many Platonists of today believe that inaccessible cardinals exist, even though the statement that they exist is not  formal theorem of ZFC (see IV 6.9). Since what is “really true” for some Platonists may not be so for others, one cannot specify precisely what the platonistic metatheory is. Fortunately, in this book we need only assume that the metatheory contains all finitistic reasoning. §4. What we are describing We present here an informal discussion of the intended interpretation of the axioms of ZFC. The fact that there are other possible interpretations is the basis for all our independence proofs. An interpretation of the language of set theory is defined by specifying  non-empty domain of discourse, over which the variables are intended to vary, together with  binary relation on that domain, which is the interpre- tation of . If ¢ is any sentence in the language of set theory, ¢ is either true or false under  specified interpretation. As  frivolous example, we may let the domain of discourse be the set  of integers, and interpret xe yas  < . This is  legitimate interpretation for the language of set theory, even though the sentence vx 3y(yex) is true under this interpretation but refutable from ZFC. Of course, not all the axioms of ZFC are true under this interpretation. In the intended interpretation, under which the axioms of ZFC are pre- sumed true, € is interpreted to mean that  is  member of , but the domain of discourse is somewhat harder to describe. In accordance with the belief that set theory is the foundation of mathematics, we should be able to capture all of mathematics by just talking about sets, so our variables should not range over objects like cows and pigs. But if  is  cow, {} is  set, but not  legitimate mathematical object. More generally, since we wish to talk only about sets but also should be able to talk about any ele- ment ofa set in our domain of discourse, all the elements of such  set should
