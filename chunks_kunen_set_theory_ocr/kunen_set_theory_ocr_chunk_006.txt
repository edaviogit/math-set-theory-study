the chapters than most readers will want to do. It is not necessary to read the book straight through from cover to cover. In particular, the material in Chapter II is not used at all until the end of

=== 第12页 === xiv Introduction Chapter VI, so the reader may simply skip Chapter II and refer back to it as needed. Also,  knowledge of constructibility is not necessary to under- stand forcing, so it is possible to read Chapters VII and VIII without reading Chapters  and VI, although the reader doing this would have to take on faith the existence of models of GCH. Furthermore, the appendices of all chapters may be omitted without loss of continuity. §5. What has been omitted We have two goals in writing this book. First, we hope to bridge the gap between the current literature and the elementary texts on cardinals and ordinals. Second, we hope to emphasize the interplay between classical combinatorial set theory and modem independence proofs. Much important material in set theory which is secondary to these goals has been omitted. Specifically, topics which are already well covered in the literature by texts or survey articles have often been omitted. We have little here on large cardinals: the interested reader may consult [Drake 1974] or [Solovay— Reinhardt-Kanamori 1978]. Likewise, we do not treat the fine-structure methods in ; see [Devlin 1973] for this. We have also avoided topics which require some sophistication in logic. In particular, we do not discuss model-theoretic applications of large cardinals (see [Drake 1974]), or results in descriptive set theory, or the relationship between these fields (see [Martin 1977] or [Moschovakis 198O}). st book gives short shrift to the Axiom of Choice (AC). We consider AC to be one of the basic axioms of set theory, although we do indicate proofs that it is neither provable (see VII Exercise E4) nor refutable (see  2.14 and VI 4.9) from the other axioms. For more on set theory without AC, see [Jech 1973]. §6. On references Since this is  text and not  research monograph, we have not attempted to give references to the literature for every theorem we prove. Our bibliog- raphy is intended primarily as suggestions for further reading, and not as  source for establishing priority. We apologize to those mathematicians who are chagrined at not seeing their name mentioned more often. Aside from  few trivial exercises, none of the results in this book are due to the author.
