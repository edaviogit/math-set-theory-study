=== 第4O页 === 26 The foundations of set theory {Ch. 1, 89 To express the uniqueness statement in Theorem 9.3, let ’(, ) be any other formula and let (3) be like (3) but with ’ instead of . Then the fol- lowing is also  theorem: [vx 3! (, ) 4 (3) ] + Va Vy (GE, ) >  (, )). Fortunately, it is rarely necessary in mathematical arguments about classes to translate away the classes; it is, however, important to know that this can be done in principle. One may think of the operations « +  and  - Bas being defined by trans- finite recursion on , with « as  fixed parameter, although it is easier to check their properties directly from the definitions given in §7. We dwell somewhat on the recursive definition of  +  to illustrate how the usual informal manner of presenting recursive definitions can, if desired, be re- duced to Theorem 9.3. Informally, we could have defined « + 8 by recursion on  via the clauses: +O=.  + () = ( + ). +  =sup{ + €:€ < } when Pisa limit ordinal. Since the function + as defined in 7.17. satisfies these clauses (by 7.18 (2), (4), (5), the two definitions are equivalent. More formally, we interject first  definition. 9.4, DEFINITION.  — | is  if  is  limit or O, and » if  = ().  Now, for each , define ,:  >  so that ,() is O unless  is  function with domain some ordinal , in which case ,() is « if  = O, (( — 1)) if  is  successor, and |) {(é):€ < } if  is  limit. Then Theorem 9.3 yieldsa unique , : ON >  such that VB [,() = ,(,{)]. The unique- ness implies, using Lemma 7.18 (2), (4), (5), that VaB [,() = « + 6]. More formally still, the subscripted « becomes an additional free variable in the formula  occurring in our official explication of Theorem 9.3. One can also define - by recursion using the clauses in Lemma 7.2O (2), (4), (5).  more useful application of recursion is in defining ordinal exponentia- tion, since  direct combinatorial definition of  is slightly complicated (see Exercise 7). 9.5. DEFINITION.  is defined by recursion on  by (3) If  is  limit,  = sup{:é <}.

If : > , there is  unique function  with domain 6 such that Va < 6 [(@) = (gf )]; to see this, let : ON —  be the function satisfying (2), and let  = Gf 6.  is  set by the Axiom of Replacement. An important special case, when 6 = @, is often used in arithmetic. For example, we define ! by the clauses: !=1. (+ Dl=nl-(n4+ 1). This may be cast more formally in the form of Theorem 9.3 as in the dis- cussion of « + 8 above. Here there are only two clauses, as there are no limit ordinals < @. §1O.
