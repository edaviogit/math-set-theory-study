=== 第5页 === PREFACE This book provides an introduction to relative consistency proofs in axiomatic set theory, and is intended to be used as  text in beginning graduate courses in that subject. It is hoped that this treatment will make the subject accessible to those mathematicians whose research is sensitive to axiomatics. We assume that the reader has had the equivalent of an under- graduate course on cardinals and ordinals, but no specific training in logic is necessary. The author is grateful to the large number of people who have suggested improvements in the original manuscript for this book. In particular we would like to thank John Baldwin, Eric van Douwen, Peter Nyikos, and Dan Velleman. Special thanks are due to Jon Barwise, who tried out the manuscript in  course at the University of Wisconsin.
