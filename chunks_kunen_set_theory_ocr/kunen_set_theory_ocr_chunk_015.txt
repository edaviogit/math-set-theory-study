mathematical object. More generally, since we wish to talk only about sets but also should be able to talk about any ele- ment ofa set in our domain of discourse, all the elements of such  set should

Repeating this, we shall understand that our domain of dis- course consists of those  such that xisaset, and Vy(yex > yisaset), and vzVy(yex  zey—>zisaset), andete. We say such an  is hereditarily  set. Examples of such sets are O (the empty set), {O}, {O, {{O}}}. etc. The following is  more set-theoretic way of looking at the hereditary sets. Let (|)  be the union of all the sets in . Let ()° =  and ()"*! = (" ). Then  is an hereditary set iffx is  set and for each  = O, 1,2, . all elements of |)"  are sets. An important feature of our domain of discourse is that every element of an hereditary set is an hereditary set. This is needed to see the truth of the Axiom of Extensionality (see §5). The intended interpretation of set theory will be further discussed in III §4. We tum now to ad hoc interpretations; this is the basis of all consistency proofs in this book. If  is any set of sentences, we may show  is consistent by producing any interpretation under which all sentences of  are true. Usually, € will be still interpreted as membership, but the domain of dis- course will be some sub-domain of the hereditary sets. Thus, we shall produce one interpretation for ZFC + CH and another for ZFC + 4CH without ever deciding whether CH is true in the intended interpretation. The justification for this method of producing consistency proofs is the easy direction of the Gddel Completeness Theorem; that if  holds in some interpretation, then  is consistent. The reason this theorem holds is that the rules of formal deduction are set up so that if § + ¢, then @ must be true under any interpretation which makes all sentences in  true. If we fix an interpretation in which $ holds, then any sentence false in that interpreta- tion is not provable from . Since 1@ and @ cannot both hold in  given interpretation,  cannot prove both @ and 74; thus,  is consistent. The non-trivial direction of the Gddel Completeness Theorem is that if  is consistent, then  holds in some interpretation, whose domain of dis- course may be taken to be  countable set (but we may not be able to inter- pret € as real membership). We do not need this result in our work, but it is of interest, since it shows that the notion of consistency is not tied to  particular development of formal derivability. In fact, if we allow infinitistic methods in the metatheory, we may dispense entirely with formal proofs and define  to be consistent iff  holds in some interpretation, and define St @ iff  is true in every interpretation which makes all sentences of  true. It is then much easier to see when St ¢. In this approach, the Compact- ness Theorem (2.1) becomes  deep result rather than  trivial remark.
