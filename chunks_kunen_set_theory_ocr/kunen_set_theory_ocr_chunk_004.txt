ns with  background in set theory often retum to the basic methods to prove consistency results for specific mathematical statements which do not follow from one of the known “quotable” principles. xi

=== 第1O页 === xii Introduction The purpose of this book is to explain the basic techniques for proving statements consistent with ZFC. We include consistency proofs for many of the “quotable” principles. More importantly, we hope to enable mathe- maticians to produce new consistency proofs of their own, as needed. §2. Prerequisites We assume that the reader has seen  development of axiomatic set theory through the basic properties of von Neumann ordinals and cardinals. This material is contained in set theory texts such as [Enderton 1977] or [Halmos 196O], as well as in appendices to books in other areas of mathe- matics which use set theory, such as [Chang-Keisler 1973] or [Kelley 1955]. This material is also reviewed in Chapter . It is not necessary for the reader to have seen the particular axiom system ZFC. There are other systems which differ from ZFC in the formal way proper classes are handled (see  §12).  reader familiar with one of these should have no trouble with ZFC, but should bear in mind that in ZFC proper classes have no formal existence, and all variables range over sets. The reader need not be knowledgeable about very picky axiomatic questions—such as which axioms of ZFC are used to prove which theorems. In those few cases where such questions are of any importance, they are reviewed quite extensively in Chapter 1. However, we do presume some sophistication in the way set theory is handled in its mathematical applica- tions, as one would see in  course in general topology or measure theory. Our prerequisite in formal logic is elastic.  book whose main results involve consistency of axiomatic systems cannot avoid logic entirely. We have included  sketch of background material on formal logic to enable readers with no training in the subject to understand independence proofs, but such readers might be suspicious about the complete mathematical rigor of our methods.  good undergraduate course in logic would dispel that suspicion. On  higher level, there are many foundational questions raised by our subject which are of interest to the student of logic per se, and we have collected such material in appendices to the various chapters. In these appendices, we have felt free to assume as much logical sophistica- tion as is needed for the particular argument at hand. §3. Outline Chapter  contains some logical background and  sketch of the develop- ment of the axioms of ZFC, excluding Foundation (Regularity). Since this material is partly  review, we have omitted many proofs. We have been
