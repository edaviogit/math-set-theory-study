in every interpretation which makes all sentences of  true. It is then much easier to see when St ¢. In this approach, the Compact- ness Theorem (2.1) becomes  deep result rather than  trivial remark.

=== 第24页 === 1O The foundations of set theory (Ch. 1, 85 We now explain why it is of interest that some elementary set theory can be developed without the full strength of ZFC. When we define an inter- pretation for, say, ZFC + CH, it will not be trivial to verify immediately that all axioms of ZFC do indeed hold in our interpretation. We shall first check that  weak theory, such as ZF —  — Inf holds; this will imply that some simple set-theoretic facts are true, which will make it easier to under- stand what the axioms of Choice, Power Set, and Infinity mean under this interpretation. §5. Extensionality and Comprehension We begin to list and discuss the axiom of ZFC. Axiom O. Set Existence. ax( =).  This axiom says that our universe is non-void. Under most developments of formal logic, this is derivable from the logical axioms and thus redundant to state here, but we do so for emphasis. Axiom |. Extensionality. Vx Vy(Vz(zexozey)>=).  This says that  set is determined by its members. To recognize(informally) the truth of this axiom, it is important to note, by our discussion in §4, that the variables , ,  range only over the hereditary sets. Given hereditary sets  and , ¥( © + ) means that  and  have the same hereditary sets as members; but all members of  and  must be hereditary sets, so  and  have the same members and are hence the same set. The Comprehension Axiom is intended to formalize the construction of sets of the form {: ()} where () denotes some property of . Since the notion of property is made rigorous via formulas, it is tempting to set forth as axioms statements of the form dy Wx(xey@), where ¢ is  formula. Unfortunately, such  scheme is inconsistent by the famous Russell paradox: If @ is  ¢ , then this axiom gives us   such that Vx(xeyox¢?), whence  € + ¢ . Fortunately in mathematical applications it is sufficient to be able to use  property () to define  subset of  given set, so we postu- late Comprehension as follows.

=== 第25页 === Ch. 1, $5) Extensionality and Comprehension 1 Axiom 3. Comprehension Scheme. For each formula ¢ without  free, the universal closure of the following is an axiom: Fy Vx(xeyoxez ag)  @ may have any number of other variables free. The  asserted to exist is unique by Extensionality, and we denote this  by {xixez ao} or {xeEz: 9}. Variables other than  which are free in @ are considered parameters in this definition ofa subset of . Our restriction on  not being free in ¢ eliminates self-referential defini- tions of sets, for example, dy VWx(xeyoxez Ax¢gy) would be inconsistent with the existence of  non-empty . Note that the Comprehension Scheme, although it expresses one idea, yields an infinite collection of axioms—one for each ¢. If  is any set, we may form, by Comprehension, { €: + }, which is then  set with no members. By Axiom O, some set  exists, so there is  set with no members. By Extensionality, such  set is unique. We are thus justi- fied in making: 5.1. DEFINITION. O is the unique set  such that Vx(¢).  We can also prove that there is no universal set. 5.2. THEOREM. 32 Vx ( €). Proor. If Vx(xez), then, by Comprehension, form {xez:¢} = {:¢}, which would yield  contradiction by the Russell paradox dis- cussed above. O We let    abbreviate Vx(xe  + €). So, Ac AandOc . O is the only set which can be proved to exist from Axioms O, 1, and 3. To see this, consider the interpretation whose domain of discourse contains only the empty set, with € interpreted as the (vacuous) membership rela- tion. Axioms O, 1, and 3 hold in this interpretation, but so does Vy( = O), so Axioms O, 1, and 3 cannot refute Vy ( = O) (see 1V 2.8 for  more formal presentation of this argument). Of course, we need more axioms.
