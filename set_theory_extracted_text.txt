They originated as handwritten notes in a course at the University of Toronto given by Prof. William Weiss. Cynthia Church pro- duced the ﬁrst electronic copy in December 2002. James Talmage Adams produced the copy here in February 2005. Chapters 1 to 9 are close to ﬁ- nal form. Chapters 10, 11, and 12 are quite readable, but should not be considered as a ﬁnal draft. One more chapter will be added. 6 CONTENTS Chapter 0 Introduction Set Theory is the true study of inﬁnity. This alone assures the subject of a place prominent in human culture. But even more, Set Theory is the milieu in which mathematics takes place today. As such, it is expected to provide a ﬁrm foundation for the rest of mathematics. And it does—up to a point; we will prove theorems shedding light on this issue. Because the fundamentals of Set Theory are known to all mathemati- cians, basic problems in the subject seem elementary. Here are three simple statements about sets and functions. They look like they could appear on a homework assignment in an undergraduate course. 1. For any two sets X and Y , either there is a one-to-one function from X into Y or a one-to-one function from Y into X. 2. If there is a one-to-one function from X into Y and also a one-to-one function from Y into X, then there is a one-to-one function from X onto Y . 3. If X is a subset of the real numbers, then either there is a one-to-one function from the set of real numbers into X or there is a one-to-one function from X into the set of rational numbers. They won’t appear on an assignment, however, because they are quite dif- 7 8 CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION ﬁcult to prove. Statement (2) is true; it is called the Schroder-Bemstein Theorem. The proof, if you haven’t seen it before, is quite tricky but never- theless uses only standard ideas from the nineteenth century. Statement (1) is also true, but its proof needed a new concept from the twentieth century, a new axiom called the Axiom of Choice. Statement (3) actually was on a homework assignment of sorts. It was the ﬁrst problem in a tremendously inﬂuential list of twenty-three problems posed by David Hilbert to the 1900 meeting of the Intemational Congress of Mathematicians. Statement (3) is a reformulation of the famous Continuum Hypothesis. We don’t know if it is true or not, but there is hope that the twenty-ﬁrst century will bring a solution. We do know, however, that another new axiom will be needed here. All these statements will be discussed later in the book. Although Elementary Set Theory is well-known and straightforward, the modem subject, Axiomatic Set Theory, is both conceptually more diﬃcult and more interesting. Complex issues arise in Set Theory more than any other area of pure mathematics; in particular, Mathematical Logic is used in a fundamental way. Although the necessary logic is presented in this book, it would be beneﬁcial for the reader to have taken a prior course in logic under the auspices of mathematics, computer science or philosophy. In fact, it would be beneﬁcial for everyone to have had a course in logic, but most people seem to make their way in the world without one. In order to introduce one of the thomy issues, let’s consider the set of all those numbers which can be easily described, say in fewer then twenty English words. This leads to something called Richard’s Paradox. The set {x : x is a number which can be described in fewer than twenty English words} must be ﬁnite since there are only ﬁnitely many English words. Now, there are inﬁnitely many counting numbers (i.e., the natural numbers) and so there must be some counting number (in fact inﬁnitely many of them) which are not in our set. So there is a smallest counting number which is not in the set. This number can be uniquely described as “the smallest counting number which cannot be described in fewer than twenty English words”. Count them—14 words. So the number must be in the set. But it can’t be in the set. That’s 9 a contradiction. What is wrong here? Our naive intuition about sets is wrong here. Not every collection of numbers with a description is a set. In fact it would be better to stay away from using languages like English to describe sets. Our ﬁrst task will be to build a new language for describing sets, one in which such contradictions cannot arise. We also need to clarify exactly what is meant by “set”. What is a set? We do not know the complete answer to this question. Many problems are still unsolved simply because we do not know whether or not certain objects constitute a set or not. Most of the proposed new axioms for Set Theory are of this nature. Nevertheless, there is much that we do know about sets and this book is the beginning of the story. 10 CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION Chapter 1 LOST We construct a language suitable for describing sets. The symbols: variables v0, v1, v2, . . . equality symbol = membership symbol ∈ logical connectives ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔ quantiﬁers ∀, ∃ parentheses (, ) The atomic formulas are strings of symbols of the form: (vi ∈vj) or (vi = vj) The collection of formulas of set theory is deﬁned as follows: 1. An atomic formula is a formula. 2. If Φ is any formula, then (¬Φ) is also a formula. 3. If Φ and Ψ are formulas, then (Φ ∧Ψ) is also a formula. 11 12 CHAPTER 1. LOST 4. If Φ and Ψ are formulas, then (Φ ∨Ψ) is also a formula. 5. If Φ and Ψ are formulas, then (Φ →Ψ) is also a formula. 6. If Φ and Ψ are formulas, then (Φ ↔Ψ) is also a formula. 7. If Φ is a formula and vi is a variable, then (∀vi)Φ is also a formula. 8. If Φ is a formula and vi is a variable, then (∃vi)Φ is also a formula. Furthermore, any formula is built up this way from atomic formulas and a ﬁnite number of applications of the inferences 2 through 8. Now that we have speciﬁed a language of set theory, we could specify a proof system. We will not do this here—see n diﬀerent logic books for n diﬀerent proof systems. However, these are essentially all the same— satisfying the completeness theorem (due to K. G¨odel) which essentially says that any formula either has a proof or it has an interpretation in which it is false (but not both!). In all these proof systems we have the usual logical equivalences which are common to everyday mathematics. For example: For any formulas Φ and Ψ: (¬(¬(Φ))) is equivalent to Φ; (Φ ∧Ψ) is equivalent to ¬((¬Φ) ∨(¬Ψ)); (Φ →Ψ) is equivalent to ((¬Φ) ∨Ψ); (Φ ↔Ψ) is equivalent to ((Φ →Ψ) ∧(Ψ →Φ)); (∃vi)Φ is equivalent to (¬(∀vi)(¬Φ)); and, (Φ ↔Ψ) is equivalent to (Ψ ↔Φ). The complete collection of subformulas of a formula Φ is deﬁned as fol- lows: 1. Φ is a subformula of Φ; 2. If (¬Ψ) is a subformula of Φ, then so is Ψ; 3. If (Θ ∧Ψ) is a subformula of Φ, then so are Θ and Ψ; 13 4. If (Θ ∨Ψ) is a subformula of Φ, then so are Θ and Ψ; 5. If (Θ →Ψ) is a subformula of Φ, then so are Θ and Ψ; 6. If (Θ ↔Ψ) is a subformula of Φ, then so are Θ and Ψ; 7. If (∀vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ and vi is a variable, then Ψ is a subformula of Φ; and, 8. If (∃vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ and vi is a variable, then Ψ is a subformula of Φ. Note that the subformulas of Φ are those formulas used in the construction of Φ. To say that a variable vi occurs bound in a formula Φ means one of the following two conditions holds: 1. For some subformula Ψ of Φ, (∀vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ; or, 2. For some subformula Ψ of Φ, (∃vi)Ψ is a subformula of Φ. The result, Φ∗, of substituting the variable vj for each bound occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ is deﬁned by constructing a Ψ∗for each subformula Ψ of Φ as follows: 1. If Ψ is atomic, then Ψ∗is Ψ; 2. If Ψ is (¬Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (¬Θ∗); 3. If Ψ is (Γ ∧Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗∧Θ∗); 4. If Ψ is (Γ ∨Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗∨Θ∗); 5. If Ψ is (Γ →Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗→Θ∗); 6. If Ψ is (Γ ↔Θ) for some formula Θ, then Ψ∗is (Γ∗↔Θ∗); 7. If Ψ is (∀vk)Θ for some formula Θ then Ψ∗is just (∀vk)Θ∗if k ̸= i, but if k = i then Ψ∗is (∀vj)Γ where Γ is the result of substituting vj for each occurrence of vi in Θ; and, 14 CHAPTER 1. LOST 8. If Ψ is (∃vk)Θ for some formula Θ then Ψ∗is just (∃vk)Θ∗if k ̸= i, but if k = i then Ψ∗is (∃vj)Γ where Γ is the result of substituting vj for each occurrence of vi in Θ. That a variable vi occurs free in a formula Φ means that at least one of the following is true: 1. Φ is an atomic formula and vi occurs in Φ; 2. Φ is (¬Ψ), Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ; 3. (Θ ∧Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 4. Φ is (Θ ∨Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 5. Φ is (Θ →Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 6. Φ is (Θ ↔Ψ), Θ and Ψ are formulas and vi occurs free in Θ or occurs free in Ψ; 7. Φ is (∀vj)Ψ and Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ and i ̸= j; or, 8. Φ is (∃vj)Ψ and Ψ is a formula and vi occurs free in Ψ and i ̸= j. As in the example below, a variable can occur both free and bound in a formula. However, notice that if a variable occurs in a formula at all it must occur either free, or bound, or both (but not at the same occurrence). We deﬁne the important notion of the substitution of a variable vj for each free occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ. This procedure is as follows. 1. Substitute a new variable vl for all bound occurrences of vi in Φ. 2. Substitute another new variable vk for all bound occurrences of vj in the result of (1). 15 3. Directly substitute vj for each occurrence of vi in the result of (2). Example. Let us substitute v2 for all free occurrences of v1 in the formula ((∀v1)((v1 = v2) →(v1 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) The steps are as follows. 1. ((∀v1)((v1 = v2) →(v1 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) 2. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v2)(v2 ∈v1)) 3. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v4)(v4 ∈v1)) 4. ((∀v3)((v3 = v2) →(v3 ∈v0)) ∧(∃v4)(v4 ∈v2)) For the reader who is new to this abstract game of formal logic, step (2) in the substitution proceedure may appear to be unnecessary. It is indeed necessary, but the reason is not obvious until we look again at the example to see what would happen if step (2) were omitted. This step essentially changes (∃v2)(v2 ∈v1) to (∃v4)(v4 ∈v1). We can agree that each of these means the same thing, namely, “v1 is non-empty”. However, when v2 is directly substituted into each we get something diﬀerent: (∃v2)(v2 ∈v2) and (∃v4)(v4 ∈v2). The latter says that “v2 is non-empty” and this is, of course what we would hope would be the result of substituting v2 for v1 in “v1 is non-empty”. But the former statement, (∃v2)(v2 ∈v2), seems quite diﬀerent, making the strange assertion that “v2 is an element of itself”, and this is not what we have in mind. What caused this problem? An occurrence of the variable v2 became bound as a result of being substituted for v1. We will not allow this to happen. When we substitute v2 for the free v1 we must ensure that this freedom is preserved for v2. For a formula Φ and variables vi and vj, let Φ(vilvj) denote the formula which results from substituting vj for each free occurance of vi. In order to make Φ(vilvj) well deﬁned, we insist that in steps (1) and (2) of the substitution process, the ﬁrst new variable available is used. Of course, the use of any other new variable gives an equivalent formula. In the example, if Φ is the formula on the ﬁrst line, then Φ(v1lv2) is the formula on the fourth line. 16 CHAPTER 1. LOST As a simple application we can show how to express “there exists a unique element”. For any formula Φ of the language of set theory we denote by (∃!vj)Φ the formula ((∃vj)Φ ∧(∀vj)(∀vl)((Φ ∧Φ(vjlvl)) →(vj = vl))) where vl is the ﬁrst available variable which does not occur in Φ. The ex- pression (∃!vj) can be considered as an abbreviation in the language of set theory, that is, an expression which is not actually part of the language. However, whenever we have a formula containing this expression, we can quickly convert it to a proper formula of the language of set theory. A class is just a string of symbols of the form {vi : Φ} where vi is a variable and Φ is a formula. Two important and well-known examples are: {v0 : (¬(v0 = v0))} which is called the empty set and is usually denoted by ∅, and {v0 : (v0 = v0)} which is called the universe and is usually denoted by V. A term is deﬁned to be either a class or a variable. Terms are the names for what the language of set theory talks about. A grammatical analogy is that terms correspond to nouns and pronouns—classes to nouns and variables to pronouns. Continuing the analogy, the predicates, or verbs, are = and ∈. The atomic formulas are the basic relationships among the predicates and the variables. We can incorporate classes into the language of set theory by showing how the predicates relate to them. Let Ψ and Θ be formulas of the language of set theory and let vj, vk and vl be variables. We write: vk ∈{vj : Ψ} instead of Ψ(vjlvk) vk = {vj : Ψ} instead of (∀vl)((vl ∈vk) ↔Ψ(vjlvl)) {vj : Ψ} = vk instead of (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔(vl ∈vk)) {vj : Ψ} = {vk : Θ} instead of (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔Θ(vklvl)) {vj : Ψ} ∈vk instead of (∃vl)((vl ∈vk) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) {vj : Ψ} ∈{vk : Θ} instead of (∃vl)(Θ(vklvl) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) 17 whenever vl is neither vj nor vk and occurs in neither Ψ nor Θ. We can now show how to express, as a proper formula of set theory, the substitution of a term t for each free occurrence of the variable vi in the formula Φ. We denote the resulting formula of set theory by Φ(vilt). The case when t is a variable vj has already been discussed. Now we tum our attention to the case when t is a class {vj : Ψ} and carry out a proceedure similar to the variable case. 1. Substitute the ﬁrst available new variable for all bound occurrences of vi in Φ. 2. In the result of (1), substitute, in tum, the ﬁrst available new variable for all bound occurrences of each variable which occurs free in Ψ. 3. In the result of (2), directly substitute {vj : Ψ} for vi into each atomic subformula in tum, using the table above. For example, the atomic subformula (vi ∈vk) is replaced by the new subfor- mula (∃vl)((vl ∈vk) ∧(∀vj)((vj ∈vl) ↔Ψ)) where vl is the ﬁrst available new variable. Likewise, the atomic subformula (vi = vi) is replaced by the new subformula (∀vl)(Ψ(vjlvl) ↔Ψ(vjlvl)) where vl is the ﬁrst available new variable (although it is not important to change from vj to vl in this particular instance). 18 CHAPTER 1. LOST Chapter 2 FOUND The language of set theory is very precise, but it is extremely diﬃcult for us to read mathematical formulas in that language. We need to ﬁnd a way to make these formulas more intelligible. In order to avoid the inconsistencies associated with Richard’s paradox, we must ensure that the formula Φ in the class {vj : Φ} is indeed a proper formula of the language of set theory—or, at least, can be converted to a proper formula once the abbreviations are eliminated. It is not so important that we actually write classes using proper formulas, but what is important is that whatever formula we write down can be converted into a proper formula by eliminating abbreviations and slang. We can now relax our formalism if we keep the previous paragraph in mind. Let’s adopt these conventions. 1. We can use any letters that we like for variables, not just v0, v1, v2, . . . . 2. We can freely omit parentheses and sometimes use brackets ] and [ instead. 3. We can write out “and” for “∧”, “or” for “∨”, “implies” for “→” and use the “if...then...” format as well as other common English expres- sions for the logical connectives and quantiﬁers. 19 20 CHAPTER 2. FOUND 4. We will use the notation Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wk) to indicate that all free variables of Φ lie among x, y, w1, . . . , wk. When the context is clear we use the notation Φ(x, t, w1, . . . , wk) for the result of substituting the term t for each free occurrence of the variable y in Φ, i.e., Φ(ylt). 5. We can write out formulas, including statements of theorems, in any way easily seen to be convertible to a proper formula in the language of set theory. For any terms r, s, and t, we make the following abbreviations of formulas. (∀x ∈t)Φ for (∀x)(x ∈t →Φ) (∃x ∈t)Φ for (∃x)(x ∈t ∧Φ) s /∈t for ¬(s ∈t) s ̸= t for ¬(s = t) s ⊆t for (∀x)(x ∈s →x ∈t) Whenever we have a ﬁnite number of terms t1, t2, . . . , tn the notation {t1, t2, . . . , tn} is used as an abbreviation for the class: {x : x = t1 ∨x = t2 ∨· · · ∨x = tn}. Furthermore, {t : Φ} will stand for {x : x = t ∧Φ}, while {x ∈t : Φ} will represent {x : x ∈t ∧Φ}. We also abbreviate the following important classes. Union s ∪t for {x : x ∈s ∨x ∈t} Intersection s ∩t for {x : x ∈s ∧x ∈t} Diﬀerence s \ t for {x : x ∈s ∧x /∈t} Symmetric Diﬀerence s△t for (s \ t) ∪(t \ s) Ordered Pair ⟨s, t⟩ for {{s}, {s, t}} Cartesian Product s × t for {p : ∃x ∃y (x ∈s ∧y ∈t ∧p = ⟨x, y⟩)} Domain dom(f) for {x : ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Range mg(f) for {y : ∃x ⟨x, y⟩∈f} 21 Image f →A for {y : ∃x ∈A ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Inverse Image f ←B for {x : ∃y ∈B ⟨x, y⟩∈f} Restriction flA for {p : p ∈f ∧∃x ∈A ∃y p = ⟨x, y⟩} Inverse f −1 for {p : ∃x ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f ∧⟨y, x⟩= p} These latter abbreviations are most often used when f is a function. We write f is a function for ∀p ∈f ∃x ∃y p = ⟨x, y⟩∧(∀x)(∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈f →∃!y ⟨x, y⟩∈f) and we write f : X →Y for f is a function ∧dom(f) = X ∧mg(f) ⊆Y f is one −to −one for ∀y ∈mg(f) ∃!x ⟨x, y⟩∈f f is onto Y for Y = mg(f) We also use the terms injection (for a one-to-one function), surjection (for an onto function), and bijection (for both properties together). Russell’s Paradox The following is a theorem. ¬∃z z = {x : x /∈x}. The proof of this is simple. Just ask whether or not z ∈z. The paradox is only for the naive, not for us. {x : x /∈x} is a class—just a description in the language of set theory. There is no reason why what it describes should exist. In everyday life we describe many things which don’t exist, ﬁctional characters for example. Bertrand Russell did exist and Peter Pan did not, although they each have descriptions in English. Although Peter Pan does not exist, we still ﬁnd it worthwhile to speak about him. The same is true in mathematics. Upon reﬂection, you might say that in fact, nothing is an element of itself so that {x : x /∈x} = {x : x = x} = V 22 CHAPTER 2. FOUND and so Russell’s paradox leads to: ¬∃z z = V. It seems we have proved that the universe does not exists. A pity! The mathematical universe fails to have a mathematical existence in the same way that the physical universe fails to have a physical existence. The things that have a physical existence are exactly the things in the universe, but the universe itself is not an object in the universe. This does bring up an important point—do any of the usual mathematical objects exist? What about the other things we described as classes? What about ∅? Can we prove that ∅exists? Actually, we can’t; at least not yet. You can’t prove very much, if you don’t assume something to start. We could prove Russell’s Paradox because, amazingly, it only required the basic rules of logic and required nothing mathematical—that is, nothing about the “real meaning” of ∈. Continuing from Russell’s Paradox to “¬∃z z = V” required us to assume that “∀x x /∈ x”—not an unreasonable assumption by any means, but a mathematical assumption none the less. The existence of the empty set “∃z z = ∅” may well be another necessary assumption. Generally set theorists, and indeed all mathematicians, are quite willing to assume anything which is obviously true. It is, after all, only the things which are not obviously true which need some form of proof. The problem, of course, is that we must somehow know what is “obviously true”. Naively, “∃z z = V” would seem to be true, but it is not and if it or any other false statement is assumed, all our proofs become infected with the virus of inconsistency and all of our theorems become suspect. Historically, considerable thought has been given to the construction of the basic assumptions for set theory. All of mathematics is based on these assumptions; they are the foundation upon which everything else is built. These assumptions are called axioms and this system is called the ZFC Axiom System. We will begin to study it in the next chapter. Chapter 3 The Axioms of Set Theory We will explore the ZFC Axiom System. Each axiom should be “obviously true” in the context of those things that we desire to call sets. Because we cannot give a mathematical proof of a basic assumption, we must rely on intuition to determine truth, even if this feels uncomfortable. Beyond the issue of truth is the question of consistency. Since we are unable to prove that our assumptions are true, can we at least show that together they will not lead to a contradiction? Unfortunately, we cannot even do this—it is ruled out by the famous incompleteness theorems of K. G¨odel. Intuition is our only guide. We begin. We have the following axioms: The Axiom of Equality ∀x ∀y [x = y →∀z (x ∈z ↔y ∈z)] The Axiom of Extensionality ∀x ∀y [x = y ↔∀u (u ∈x ↔u ∈y)] The Axiom of Existence ∃z z = ∅ The Axiom of Pairing ∀x ∀y ∃z z = {x, y} Diﬀerent authors give slightly diﬀerent formulations of the ZFC axioms. All formulations are equivalent. Some authors omit the Axiom of Equality and Axiom of Existence because they are consequences of the usual logical background to all mathematics. We include them for emphasis. Redundancy is not a bad thing and there is considerable redundancy in this system. 23 24 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY The following theorem gives some results that we would be quite willing to assume outright, were they not to follow from the axioms. The ﬁrst three parts are immediate consequences of the Axiom of Extensionality. Theorem 1. 1. ∀x x = x. 2. ∀x ∀y x = y →y = x. 3. ∀x ∀y ∀z [(x = y ∧y = z) →x = z]. 4. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = ⟨x, y⟩. 5. ∀u ∀v ∀x ∀y [⟨u, v⟩= ⟨x, y⟩↔(u = x ∧v = y)]. Exercise 1. Prove parts (4) and (5) of Theorem 1 We now assert the existence of unions and intersections. No doubt the reader has experienced a symmetry between these two concepts. Here how- ever, while the Union Axiom is used extensively, the Intersection Axiom is redundant and is omitted in most developments of the subject. We include it here because it has some educational value (see Exercise 4). The Union Axiom ∀x [x ̸= ∅→∃z z = {w : (∃y ∈x)(w ∈y)}] The class {w : (∃y ∈x)(w ∈y)} is abbreviated as S x and called the “big union”. The Intersection Axiom ∀x [x ̸= ∅→∃z z = {w : (∀y ∈x)(w ∈y)}] The class {w : (∀y ∈x)(w ∈y)} is abbreviated as T x and called the “big intersection”. The Axiom of Foundation ∀x [x ̸= ∅→(∃y ∈x)(x ∩y = ∅)] This axiom, while it may be “obviously true”, is not certainly obvious. Let’s investigate what it says: suppose there were a non-empty x such that (∀y ∈x) (x ∩y ̸= ∅). For any z1 ∈x we would be able to get z2 ∈z1 ∩x. Since z2 ∈x we would be able to get z3 ∈z2 ∩x. The process continues forever: · · · ∈z4 ∈z3 ∈z2 ∈z1 ∈x 25 We wish to rule out such an inﬁnite regress. We want our sets to be founded: each such sequence should eventually end with the empty set. Hence the name of the axiom, which is also known as the Axiom of Regularity. It is nevertheless best understood by its consequences. Theorem 2. 1. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x ∪y. 2. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x ∩y. 3. ∀x ∀y x ∈y →y /∈x. 4. ∀x x /∈x. Exercise 2. Prove Theorem 2. Let f(x) denote the class S{y : ⟨x, y⟩∈f}. Exercise 3. Suppose f is a function and x ∈dom(f). Prove that ⟨x, y⟩∈f iﬀy = f(x). Suppose that x is a set and that there is some way of removing each element u ∈x and replacing u with some element v. Would the result be a set? Well, of course—provided there are no tricks here. That is, there should be a well deﬁned replacement procedure which ensures that each u is replaced by only one v. This well deﬁned procedure should be described by a formula, Φ, in the language of set theory. We can guarantee that each u is replaced by exactly one v by insisting that ∀u ∈x ∃!v Φ(x, u, v). We would like to obtain an axiom, written in the language of set theory stating that for each set x and each such formula Φ we get a set z. However, this is impossible. We cannot express “for each formula” in the language of set theory—in fact this formal language was designed for the express purpose of avoiding such expressions which bring us perilously close to Richard’s Paradox. The answer to this conundrum is to utilise not just one axiom, but in- ﬁnitely many—one axiom for each formula of the language of set theory. Such a system is called an axiom scheme. 26 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY The Replacement Axiom Scheme For each formula Φ(x, u, v, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory, we have the axiom: ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x [∀u ∈x ∃!v Φ →∃z z = {v : ∃u ∈x Φ}] Note that we have allowed Φ to have w1, . . . , wn as parameters, that is, free variables which may be used to specify various procedures in various contexts within a mathematical proof. This is illustrated by the following theorem. Theorem 3. ∀x ∀y ∃z z = x × y. Proof. From Theorem 1 parts (4) and (5), for all t ∈y we get ∀u ∈x ∃!v v = ⟨u, t⟩. We now use Replacement with the formula “Φ(x, u, v, t)” as “v = ⟨u, t⟩”; t is a parameter. We obtain, for each t ∈y: ∃q q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}. By Extensionality, in fact ∀t ∈y ∃!q q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}. We again use Replacement, this time with the formula Φ(y, t, q, x) as “q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}”; here x is a parameter. We obtain: ∃r r = {q : ∃t ∈y q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}} By the Union Axiom ∃z z = S r and so we have: z = {p : ∃q [q ∈r ∧p ∈q]} = {p : ∃q [(∃t ∈y) q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩} ∧p ∈q]} = {p : (∃t ∈y)(∃q)[q = {v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩} ∧p ∈q]} = {p : (∃t ∈y)p ∈{v : ∃u ∈x v = ⟨u, t⟩}} = {p : (∃t ∈y)(∃u ∈x) p = ⟨u, t⟩} = x × y 27 Exercise 4. Show that the Intersection Axiom is indeed redundant. It is natural to believe that for any set x, the collection of those elements y ∈x which satisfy some particular property should also be a set. Again, no tricks—the property should be speciﬁed by a formula of the language of set theory. Since this should hold for any formula, we are again led to a scheme. The Comprehension Scheme For each formula Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory, we have the statement: ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x ∃z z = {y : y ∈x ∧Φ(x, y, w1, . . . , wn)} This scheme could be another axiom scheme (and often is treated as such). However, this would be unnecessary, since the Comprehension Scheme follows from what we have already assumed. It is, in fact, a theorem scheme—that is, inﬁnitely many theorems, one for each formula of the language of set theory. Of course we cannot write down inﬁnitely many proofs, so how can we prove this theorem scheme? We give a uniform method for proving each instance of the scheme. So to be certain that any given instance of the theorem scheme is true, we consider the uniform method applied to that particular instance. We give this general method below. For each formula Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 4. Φ ∀w1 . . . ∀wn ∀x ∃z z = {u : u ∈x ∧Φ}. Proof. Apply Replacement with the formula Ψ(x, u, v, w1, . . . , wn) given by: (Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) →v = {u}) ∧(¬Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn) →v = ∅) to obtain: ∃y y = {v : (∃u ∈x)[(Φ →v = {u}) ∧(¬Φ →v = ∅)]}. 28 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY Note that {{u} : Φ(x, u, w1, . . . , wn)} ⊆y and the only other possible element of y is ∅. Now let z = S y to ﬁnish the proof. Theorem 4 Φ can be thought of as inﬁnitely many theorems, one for each Φ. The proof of any one of those theorems can be done in a ﬁnite number of steps, which invoke only a ﬁnite number of theorems or axioms. A proof cannot have inﬁnite length, nor invoke inﬁnitely many axioms or lemmas. We state the last of the “set behavior” axioms. The Axiom of Choice ∀X [(∀x ∈X ∀y ∈X (x = y ↔x ∩y ̸= ∅)) →∃z (∀x ∈X ∃!y y ∈x ∩z)] In human language, the Axiom of Choice says that if you have a collection X of pairwise disjoint non-empty sets, then you get a set z which contains one element from each set in the collection. Although the axiom gives the existence of some “choice set” z, there is no mention of uniqueness—there are quite likely many possible sets z which satisfy the axiom and we are given no formula which would single out any one particular z. The Axiom of Choice can be viewed as a kind of replacement, in which each set in the collection is replaced by one of its elements. This leads to the following useful reformulation which will be used in Theorem 22. Theorem 5. There is a choice function on any set of non-empty sets; i.e., ∀X [∅/∈X →(∃f)(f : X → [ X ∧(∀x ∈X)(f(x) ∈x))]. Proof. Given such an X, by Replacement there is a set Y = {{x} × x : x ∈X} which satisﬁes the hypothesis of the Axiom of Choice. So, ∃z ∀y ∈Y ∃!p p ∈ y ∩z. Let f = z ∩(S Y ). Then f : X →S X and each f(x) ∈x. 29 We state the last of the “set creation” axioms. The Power Set Axiom ∀x ∃z z = {y : y ⊆x} We denote {y : y ⊆x} by P(x), called the power set of x. For reasons to be understood later, it is important to know explicitly when the Power Set Axiom is used. This completes the list of the ZFC Axiom System with one exception to come later—higher analogues of the Axiom of Existence. 30 CHAPTER 3. THE AXIOMS OF SET THEORY Chapter 4 The Natural Numbers We now construct the natural numbers. That is, we will represent the natural numbers in our universe of set theory. We will construct a number system which behaves mathematically exactly like the natural numbers, with exactly the same arithmetic and order properties. We will not claim that what we construct are the actual natural numbers—whatever they are made of. But we will take the liberty of calling our constructs “the natural numbers”. We begin by taking 0 as the empty set ∅. We write 1 for {0} 2 for {0, 1} 3 for {0, 1, 2} succ(x) for x ∪{x} We write “n is a natural number” for [n = ∅∨(∃l ∈n)(n = succ(l))] ∧(∀m ∈n)[m = ∅∨(∃l ∈n)(m = succ(l))] and write: N for {n : n is a natural number} The reader can gain some familiarity with these deﬁnitions by checking that succ(n) ∈N for all n ∈N. 31 32 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We now begin to develop the basic properties of the natural numbers by introducing an important concept. We say that a term t is transitive whenever we have (∀x ∈t)(x ⊆t). Theorem 6. 1. Each natural number is transitive. 2. N is transitive; i.e., every element of a natural number is a natural number. Proof. Suppose that (1) were false; i.e., some n ∈N is not transitive, so that: {k : k ∈n and ¬(k ⊆n)} ̸= ∅. By Comprehension ∃x x = {k ∈n : ¬(k ⊆n)} and so by Foundation there is y ∈x such that y ∩x = ∅. Note that since ∅/∈x and y ∈n we have that y = succ(l) for some l ∈n. But since l ∈y, l /∈x and so l ⊆n. Hence y = l ∪{l} ⊆n, contradicting that y ∈x. We also prove (2) indirectly; suppose n ∈N with {m : m ∈n and m /∈N} ̸= ∅. By Comprehension ∃x x = {m ∈n : m /∈N} and so Foundation gives y ∈x such that y ∩x = ∅. Since y ∈n, we have y = succ(l) for some l ∈n. Since l ∈y and y ∩x = ∅we must have l ∈N. But then y = succ(l) ∈N, contradicting that y ∈x. Theorem 7. (Trichotomy of Natural Numbers) Let m, n ∈N. Exactly one of three situations occurs: m ∈n, n ∈m, m = n. Proof. That at most one occurs follows from Theorem 2. That at least one occurs follows from this lemma. 33 Lemma. Let m, n ∈N. 1. If m ⊆n, then either m = n or m ∈n. 2. If m /∈n, then n ⊆m. Proof. We begin the proof of (1) by letting S denote {x ∈N : (∃y ∈N)(y ⊆x and y ̸= x and y /∈x)}. It will suﬃce to prove that S = ∅. We use an indirect proof—pick some n1 ∈S. If n1 ∩S ̸= ∅, Foundation gives us n2 ∈n1 ∩S with n2 ∩(n1 ∩S) = ∅. By transitivity, n2 ⊆n1 so that n2 ∩S = ∅. Thus, we always have some n ∈S such that n ∩S = ∅. For just such an n, choose m ∈N with m ⊆n, m ̸= n, and m /∈n. Using Foundation, choose l ∈n \ m such that l ∩(n \ m) = ∅. Transitivity gives l ⊆n, so we must have l ⊆m. We have l ̸= m since l ∈n and m /∈n. Therefore we conclude that m \ l ̸= ∅. Using Foundation, pick k ∈m \ l such that k ∩(m \ l) = ∅. Transitivity of m gives k ⊆m and so we have k ⊆l. Now, because l ∈n we have l ∈N and l /∈S so that either k = l or k ∈l. However, k = l contradicts l /∈m and k ∈l contradicts k ∈m \ l. We prove the contrapositive of (2). Suppose that n is not a subset of m; using Foundation pick l ∈n \ m such that l ∩(n \ m) = ∅. By transitivity, l ⊆n and hence l ⊆m. Now by (1) applied to l and m, we conclude that l = m. Hence m ∈n. These theorems show that “∈” behaves on N just like the usual ordering “<” on the natural numbers. In fact, we often use “<” for “∈” when writing about the natural numbers. We also use the relation symbols ≤, >, and ≥ in their usual sense. 34 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS The next theorem scheme justiﬁes ordinary mathematical induction. For brevity let us write ⃗w for w1, . . . , wn. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 8. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n ∈N [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n ∈N Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. We will assume that the theorem is false and derive a contradiction. We have ⃗w and a ﬁxed l ∈N such that ¬Φ(l, ⃗w). Let t be any transitive subset of N containing l (e.g., t = l ∪{l}). By Comprehension, ∃s s = {n ∈t : ¬Φ(n, ⃗w)}. By Foundation, we get y ∈s such that y ∩s = ∅. Transitivity of t guarantees that (∀n ∈y) Φ(n, ⃗w). This, in tum, contradicts that y ∈s. The statement ∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w) in Theorem 8 Φ is usually called the inductive hypothesis. Exercise 5. Prove or disprove that for each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) we have ∀⃗w [(∀n ∈N)((∀m > n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)) →∀n ∈N Φ(n, ⃗w)]. Recursion on N is a way of deﬁning new terms (in particular, functions with domain N). Roughly speaking, values of a function F at larger numbers are deﬁned in terms of the values of F at smaller numbers. We begin with the example of a function F, where we set F(0) = 3 and F(succ(n)) = succ(F(n)) for each natural number n. We have set out a short recursive procedure which gives a way to calculate F(n) for any n ∈N. The reader may carry out this procedure a few steps and recognise this function F as F(n) = 3 + n. However, all this is a little vague. What exactly is F? 35 In particular, is there a formula for calculating F? How do we verify that F behaves like we think it should? In order to give some answers to these questions, let us analyse the ex- ample. There is an implicit formula for the calculation of y = F(x) which is [x = 0 →y = 3] ∧(∀n ∈N)[x = succ(n) →y = succ(F(n))] However the formula involves F, the very thing that we are trying to describe. Is this a vicious circle? No — the formula only involves the value of F at a number n less than x, not F(x) itself. In fact, you might say that the formula doesn’t really involve F at all; it just involves Flx. Let’s rewrite the formula as [x = 0 →y = 3] ∧(∀n)[x = succ(n) →y = succ(f(n))] and denote it by Φ(x, f, y). Our recursive procedure is then described by Φ(x, Flx, F(x)). In order to describe F we use functions f which approximate F on initial parts of its domain, for example f = {⟨0, 3⟩}, f = {⟨0, 3⟩, ⟨1, 4⟩} or f = {⟨0, 3⟩, ⟨1, 4⟩, ⟨2, 5⟩}, where each such f satisﬁes Φ(x, flx, f(x)) for the appropriate x’s. We will obtain F as the amalgamation of all these little f’s. F is {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈N)(∃f)[f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m))]}. But in order to justify this we will need to notice that (∀x ∈N)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y)], which simply states that we have a well deﬁned procedure given by Φ. Let us now go to the general context in which the above example will be a special case. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈N)(∃f)[f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. 36 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We will show, under the appropriate hypothesis, that REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) is the unique function on N which satisﬁes the procedure given by Φ. This requires a theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 9. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x ∈N)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, N, ⃗w), we have: 1. F : N →V; 2. ∀m ∈N Φ(m, Flm, F(m), ⃗w); and, furthermore, for any n ∈N and any function H with n ∈dom(H), we have: 3. If Φ(m, Hlm, H(m), ⃗w) for all m ∈n ∪{n}, then H(n) = F(n). Proof. We ﬁrst prove the following claim. Claim. (∀x ∈N)(∀y1)(∀y2)[(⟨x, y1⟩∈F ∧⟨x, y2⟩∈F →y1 = y2] Proof of Claim. By deﬁnition of F we have, for i = 1, 2, functions fi with domains ni ∈N such that fi(x) = yi and (∀m ∈ni) Φ(m, film, fi(m), ⃗w). It suﬃces to prove that (∀m ∈N)(m ∈x ∪{x} →f1(m) = f2(m)), which we do by induction on m ∈N. To this end, we assume that m ∈N and (∀j ∈m)(j ∈x ∪{x} →f1(j) = f2(j)) 37 with intent to show that m ∈x ∪{x} →f1(m) = f2(m). To do this suppose m ∈x ∪{x}. Since x ∈n1 ∩n2 we have m ∈n1 ∩n2 so that we have both Φ(m, f1lm, f1(m), ⃗w) and Φ(m, f2lm, f2(m), ⃗w). By transitivity j ∈x ∪{x} for all j ∈m and so by the inductive hypothesis f1lm = f2lm. Now by the hypothesis of this theorem with f = f1lm = f2lm we deduce that f1(m) = f2(m). This concludes the proof of the claim. In order to verify (1), it suﬃces to show that (∀x ∈N)(∃y) [⟨x, y⟩∈F] by induction. To this end, we assume that (∀j ∈x)(∃y) [⟨j, y⟩∈F] with intent to show that ∃y ⟨x, y⟩∈F. For each j ∈x there is nj ∈N and fj : nj →V such that (∀m ∈nj) Φ(m, fjlm, fj(m), ⃗w). If x ∈nj for some j, then ⟨x, fj(x)⟩∈F and we are done; so assume that nj ≤x for all j. Let g = S{fj : j ∈x}. By the claim, the fj’s agree on their common domains, so that g is a function with domain x and (∀m ∈x) Φ(m, glm, g(m), ⃗w). By the hypothesis of the theorem applied to g there is a unique y such that Φ(x, g, y, ⃗w). Deﬁne f to be the function f = g ∪{⟨x, y⟩}. It is straightfor- ward to verify that f witnesses that ⟨x, y⟩∈F. To prove (2), note that, by (1), for each x ∈N there is n ∈N and f : n →V such that F(x) = f(x) and, in fact, Fln = f. Hence, (∀m ∈n) Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w). 38 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS We prove (3) by induction. Assume that (∀m ∈n) H(m) = F(m) with intent to show that H(n) = F(n). We assume Φ(n, Hln, H(n), ⃗w) and by (2) we have Φ(n, Fln, F(n), ⃗w). By the hypothesis of the theorem applied to Hln = Fln we get H(n) = F(n). By applying this theorem to our speciﬁc example we see that REC(Φ, N, ⃗w) does indeed give us a function F. Since F is deﬁned by recursion on N, we use induction on N to verify the properties of F. For example, it is easy to use induction to check that F(n) ∈N for all n ∈N. We do not often explicitly state the formula Φ in a deﬁnition by recursion. The deﬁnition of F would be more often given by: F(0) = 3 F(succ(n)) = succ(F(n)) This is just how the example started; nevertheless, this allows us to construct the formula Φ immediately, should we wish. Of course, in this particular example we can use the plus symbol and give the deﬁnition by recursion by the following formulas. 3 + 0 = 3 3 + succ(n) = succ(3 + n) Now, let’s use deﬁnition by recursion in other examples. We can deﬁne general addition on N by the formulas a + 0 = a a + succ(b) = succ(a + b) for each a ∈N. Here a is a parameter which is allowed by the inclusion of ⃗w in our analysis. The same trick can be used for multiplicaton: a · 0 = 0 a · (succ(b)) = a · b + a 39 for each a ∈N, using the previously deﬁned notion of addition. In each example there are two cases to specify—the zero case and the successor case. Exponentiation is deﬁned similarly: a0 = 1 asucc(b) = ab · a The reader is invited to construct, in each case, the appropriate formula Φ, with a as a parameter, and to check that the hypothesis of the previous theorem is satisﬁed. G. Peano developed the properties of the natural numbers from zero, the successor operation and induction on N. You may like to see for yourself some of what this entails by proving that multiplication is commutative. A set X is said to be ﬁnite provided that there is a natural number n and a bijection f : n →X. In this case n is said to be the size of X. Otherwise, X is said to be inﬁnite. Exercise 6. Use induction to prove the ”pigeon-hole principle”: for n ∈N there is no injection f : (n + 1) →n. Conclude that a set X cannot have two diﬀerent sizes. Do not believe this next result: Proposition. All natural numbers are equal. Proof. It is suﬃcient to show by induction on n ∈N that if a ∈N and b ∈N and max (a, b) = n, then a = b. If n = 0 then a = 0 = b. Assume the inductive hypothesis for n and let a ∈N and b ∈N be such that max (a, b) = n + 1. Then max (a −1, b −1) = n and so a −1 = b −1 and consequently a = b. 40 CHAPTER 4. THE NATURAL NUMBERS Chapter 5 The Ordinal Numbers The natural number system can be extended to the system of ordinal num- bers. An ordinal is a transitive set of transitive sets. More formally: for any term t, “t is an ordinal” is an abbreviation for (t is transitive) ∧(∀x ∈t)(x is transitive). We often use lower case Greek letters to denote ordinals. We denote {α : α is an ordinal} by ON. From Theorem 6 we see immediately that N ⊆ON. Theorem 10. 1. ON is transitive. 2. ¬(∃z)(z = ON). Proof. 1. Let α ∈ON; we must prove that α ⊆ON. Let x ∈α; we must prove that 41 42 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS (a) x is transitive; and, (b) (∀y ∈x)(y is transitive). Clearly (a) follows from the deﬁnition of ordinal. To prove (b), let y ∈x; by transitivity of α we have y ∈α; hence y is transitive. 2. Assume (∃z)(z = ON). From (1) we have that ON is a transitive set of transitive sets, i.e., an ordinal. This leads to the contradiction ON ∈ON. Theorem 11. (Trichotomy of Ordinals) (∀α ∈ON)(∀β ∈ON)(α ∈β ∨β ∈α ∨α = β). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem 7. Because of this theorem, when α and β are ordinals, we often write α < β for α ∈β. Since N ⊆ON, it is natural to wonder whether N = ON. In fact, we know that “N = ON” can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms that we have stated (provided, of course, that those axioms are actually consistent). We ﬁnd ourselves at a crossroads in Set Theory. We can either add “N = ON” to our axiom system, or we can add “N ̸= ON”. As we shall see, the axiom “N = ON” essentially says that there are no inﬁnite sets and the axiom “N ̸= ON” essentially says that there are indeed inﬁnite sets. Of course, we go for the inﬁnite! The Axiom of Inﬁnity N ̸= ON 43 As a consequence, there is a set of all natural numbers; in fact, N ∈ON. Theorem 12. (∃z)(z ∈ON ∧z = N). Proof. Since N ⊆ON and N ̸= ON, pick α ∈ON\N. We claim that for each n ∈N we have n ∈α; in fact, this follows immediately from the trichotomy of ordinals and the transitivity of N. Thus N = {x ∈α : x ∈N} and by Comprehension ∃z z = {x ∈α : x ∈N}. The fact that N ∈ON now follows immediately from Theorem 6. The lower case Greek letter ω is reserved for the set N considered as an ordinal; i.e., ω = N. Theorems 6 and 12 now show that the natural numbers are the smallest ordinals, which are immediately succeeded by ω, after which the rest follow. The other ordinals are generated by two processes illustrated by the next lemma. Lemma. 1. ∀α ∈ON ∃β ∈ON β = succ(α). 2. ∀S [S ⊆ON →∃β ∈ON β = S S]. Exercise 7. Prove this lemma. For S ⊆ON we write sup S for the least element of {β ∈ON : (∀α ∈S)(α ≤β)} if such an element exists. Lemma. ∀S [S ⊆ON →S S = sup S] Exercise 8. Prove this lemma. An ordinal α is called a successor ordinal whenever ∃β ∈ON α = succ(β). If α = sup α, then α is called a limit ordinal. 44 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Lemma. Each ordinal is either a successor ordinal or a limit ordinal, but not both. Exercise 9. Prove this lemma. We can perform induction on the ordinals via a process called transﬁnite induction. In order to justify transﬁnite induction we need a the- orem scheme. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 13. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n ∈ON [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n ∈ON Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem scheme can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem Scheme 8. We can also carry out recursive deﬁnitions on ON. This process is called transﬁnite recursion. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, ON, ⃗w) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n ∈ON)(∃f)[f : n →V∧f(x) = y∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. Transﬁnite recursion is justiﬁed by the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 14. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x ∈ON)(∀f)[(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, ON, ⃗w), we have: 45 1. F : ON →V; 2. ∀x ∈ON Φ(x, Flx, F(x), ⃗w); and, furthermore, for any n ∈ON and any function H with n ∈ dom(H) we have: 3. If Φ(x, Hlx, H(x), ⃗w) for all x ∈n ∪{n} then H(n) = F(n). Proof. The reader may check that a proof of this theorem scheme can be obtained by replacing “N” with “ON” in the proof of Theorem Scheme 9. When applying transﬁnite recursion on ON we often have three sepa- rate cases to specify, rather than just two as with recursion on N. This is illustrated by the recursive deﬁnitions of the arithmetic operations on ON. Addition: α + 0 = α; α + succ(β) = succ(α + β); α + δ = sup {α + η : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Multiplication: α · 0 = 0; α · succ(β) = (α · β) + α; α · δ = sup {α · η : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Exponentiation: α0 = 1; αsucc(β) = (αβ) · α; αδ = sup {αη : η ∈δ}, for a limit ordinal δ. Note that, in each case, we are extending the operation from N to all of ON. The following theorem shows that these operations behave somewhat similarly on N and ON. 46 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Theorem 15. Let α, β, and δ be ordinals and S be a non-empty set of ordinals. We have, 1. 0 + α = α; 2. If β < δ then α + β < α + δ; 3. α + sup S = sup {α + η : η ∈S}; 4. α + (β + δ) = (α + β) + δ; 5. If α < β then α + δ ≤β + δ; 6. 0 · α = 0; 7. 1 · α = α; 8. If 0 < α and β < δ then α · β < α · δ; 9. α · sup S = sup {α · η : η ∈S}; 10. α · (β + δ) = (α · β) + (α · δ); 11. α · (β · δ) = (α · β) · δ; 12. If α < β then α · δ ≤β · δ; 13. 1α = 1; 14. If 1 < α and β < δ then αβ < αδ; 15. αsup S = sup {αη : η ∈S}; 16. α(β+δ) = αβ · αδ; 17. (αβ)δ = αβ·δ; and, 18. If α < β then αδ ≤βδ. Exercise 10. Build your transﬁnite induction skills by proving two parts of this theorem. 47 However, ordinal addition and multiplication are not commutative. This is illustrated by the following examples, which are easy to verify from the basic deﬁnitions. Examples. 1. 1 + ω = 2 + ω 2. 1 + ω ̸= ω + 1 3. 1 · ω = 2 · ω 4. 2 · ω ̸= ω · 2 5. 2ω = 4ω 6. (2 · 2)ω ̸= 2ω · 2ω Lemma. If β is a non-zero ordinal then ωβ is a limit ordinal. Exercise 11. Prove this lemma. Lemma. If α is a non-zero ordinal, then there is a largest ordinal β such that ωβ ≤α. Exercise 12. Prove this lemma. Show that the β ≤α and that there are cases in which β = α. Such ordinals β are called epsilon numbers (The smallest such ordinal α = ωα is called ϵ0.) Lemma. ∀α ∈ON ∀β ∈α ∃!γ ∈ON α = β + γ. Exercise 13. Prove this lemma. Commonly, any function f with dom(f) ⊆ω is called a sequence. If dom(f) ⊆n + 1 for some n ∈ω, we say that f is a ﬁnite sequence; otherwise f is an inﬁnite sequence. As usual, we denote the sequence f by {fn}, where each fn = f(n). Theorem 16. There is no inﬁnite descending sequence of ordinals. 48 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Proof. Let’s use an indirect proof. Suppose x ⊆ω is inﬁnite and f : x →ON such that if n < m then f(n) > f(m). Let X = {f(n) : n ∈x}. By Foundation there is y ∈X such that y ∩X = ∅; i.e., there is n ∈x such that f(n) ∩X = ∅. However, if m ∈x and m > n then f(m) ∈f(n), which is a contradiction. If n ∈ω and s: (n + 1) →ON is a ﬁnite sequence of ordinals, then the sum n X i=0 s(i) is deﬁned by recursion as follows. 0 X i=0 s(i) = s(0); and, m+1 X i=0 s(i) = m X i=0 s(i) + s(m + 1), for m < n. This shows that statements like the following theorem can be written precisely in the language of set theory. Theorem 17. (Cantor Normal Form) For each non-zero ordinal α there is a unique n ∈ω and ﬁnite sequences m0, . . . , mn of positive natural numbers and β0, . . . , βn of ordinals which sat- isfy β0 > β1 > · · · > βn such that α = ωβ0m0 + ωβ1m1 + · · · + ωβnmn. Proof. Using the penultimate lemma, let β0 = max {β : ωβ ≤α} and then let m0 = max {m ∈ω : ωβ0m ≤α} which must exist since ωβ0m ≤α for all m ∈ω would imply that ωβ0+1 ≤α. 49 By the previous lemma, there is some α0 ∈ON such that α = ωβ0m0 + α0 where the maximality of m0 ensures that α0 < ωβ0. Now let β1 = max {β : ωβ ≤α0} so that β1 < β0. Proceed to get m1 = max {m ∈ω : ωβ1m ≤α0} and α1 < ωβ1 such that α0 = ωβ1m1 + α1. We continue in this manner as long as possible. We must have to stop after a ﬁnite number of steps or else β0 > β1 > β2 > . . . would be an inﬁnite decreasing sequence of ordinals. The only way we could stop would be if some αn = 0. This proves the existence of the sum. Uniqueness follows by induction on α ∈ON. Exercise 14. Verify the last statement of this proof. Lemma. 1. If 0 < m < ω and α is a non-zero ordinal, then m · ωα = ωα. 2. If k ∈ω, and m0, . . . , mk < ω, and α0, . . . , αk < β, then m0 · ωα0 + · · · + mk · ωαk < ωβ. Exercise 15. Prove this lemma and note that it implies that m · δ = δ for each positive integer m and each limit ordinal δ. There is an interesting application of ordinal arithmetic to Number The- ory. Pick a number—say x = 54. We have 54 = 25 + 24 + 22 + 2 when it is written as the simplest sum of powers of 2. In fact, we can write out 54 using only the the arithmetic operations and the numbers 1 and 2. This will be the ﬁrst step in a recursively deﬁned sequence of natural numbers, {xn}. It begins with n = 2 and is constructed as follows. x2 = 54 = 2(22+1) + 222 + 22 + 2. 50 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Subtract 1. x2 −1 = 2(22+1) + 222 + 22 + 1. Change all 2’s to 3’s, leaving the 1’s alone. x3 = 3(33+1) + 333 + 33 + 1. Subtract 1. x3 −1 = 3(33+1) + 333 + 33. Change all 3’s to 4’s, leaving any 1’s or 2’s alone. x4 = 4(44+1) + 444 + 44. Subtract 1. x4 −1 = 4(44+1) + 444 + 3 · 43 + 3 · 42 + 3 · 4 + 3. Change all 4’s to 5’s, leaving any 1’s, 2’s or 3’s alone. x5 = 5(55+1) + 555 + 3 · 53 + 3 · 52 + 3 · 5 + 3. Subtract 1 and continue, changing 5’s to 6’s, subtracting 1, changing 6’s to 7’s and so on. One may ask the value of the limit lim n→∞xn. What is your guess? The answer is surprising. Theorem 18. (Goodstein) For any initial choice of x there is some n such that xn = 0. Proof. We use an indirect proof; suppose x ∈N and for all n ≥2 we have xn ̸= 0. From this sequence, we construct another sequence. For each n ≥2 we let gn be the result of replacing each occurrence of n in xn by ω. So, in the example above we would get: g2 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω + ω, g3 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω + 1, g4 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + ωω, g5 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + 3 · ω3 + 3 · ω2 + 3 · ω + 3, g6 = ω(ωω+1) + ω(ωω) + 3 · ω3 + 3 · ω2 + 3 · ω + 2, 51 etc. The previous lemma can now be used to show that {gn} would be an inﬁnite decreasing sequence of ordinals. It is interesting that, although the statement of the theorem does not mention inﬁnity in any way, we used the Axiom of Inﬁnity in its proof. We do not need the Axiom of Inﬁnity in order to verify the theorem for any one particular value of x—we just need to carry out the arithmetic. The reader can do this for x = 4; however, ﬁnishing our example x = 54 would be tedious. Moreover, the calculations are somewhat diﬀerent for diﬀerent values of x. Mathematical logicians have proved that, in fact, there is no uniform method of ﬁnitary calculations which will give a proof of the theorem for all x. The Axiom of Inﬁnity is necessary for the proof. 52 CHAPTER 5. THE ORDINAL NUMBERS Chapter 6 Relations and Orderings In the following deﬁnitions, R and C are terms. 1. We say R is a relation on C whenever R ⊆C × C. 2. We say a relation R is irreﬂexive on C whenever ∀x ∈C ⟨x, x⟩/∈R. 3. We say a relation R is transitive on C whenever ∀x ∀y ∀z [(⟨x, y⟩∈R ∧⟨y, z⟩∈R) →⟨x, z⟩∈R.] 4. We say a relation R is well founded on C whenever ∀X [(X ⊆C ∧X ̸= ∅) →(∃x ∈X ∀y ∈X ⟨y, x⟩/∈R)]. Such an x is called minimal for X. 5. We say a relation R is total on C whenever ∀x ∈C ∀y ∈C [⟨x, y⟩∈R ∨⟨y, x⟩∈R ∨x = y]. 6. We say R is extensional on C whenever ∀x ∈C ∀y ∈C [x = y ↔∀z ∈C (⟨z, x⟩∈R ↔⟨z, y⟩∈R)]. 53 54 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS An example of a relation R on an ordinal is given by the membership relation: ⟨x, y⟩∈R iﬀx ∈y. R satisﬁes all the above properties. On the other hand, if α /∈ω, the reverse relation R′ given by ⟨x, y⟩∈R′ iﬀy ∈x is not well founded but nevertheless has all the other properties. Any well founded relation is irreﬂexive. Any total relation is extensional. Any relation which is both well founded and total is also transitive. Exercise 16. Prove that a transitive set α is an ordinal iﬀthe membership relation is total on α. Suppose δ is an ordinal and f : X →δ. A relation R on X with the property that f(x) < f(y) whenever ⟨x, y⟩∈R must be a well founded relation. In fact, this tums out to be a characterisation. Theorem 19. Let R be a relation on a set X. R is well founded iﬀthere is an ordinal δ and a surjection f : X →δ such that f(x) < f(y) whenever ⟨x, y⟩∈R. Proof. We treat only the forward implication. Using recursion on ON we deﬁne g : ON →P(X) by g(β) = n x : x is a minimal element of X \ [ {g(α) : α < β} o . From g we obtain f : X →ON by f(x) = ( the unique α ∈ON with x ∈g(α), if possible; 0, otherwise. By Theorem 10 and the Axiom of Replacement there must be some least δ ∈ON such that δ /∈mg(f). This means that g(δ) = ∅, and since R is well founded we must have X = [ {g(α) : α < δ}. 55 To ﬁnish the proof suppose ⟨x, y⟩∈R and f(y) = β. We have y ∈g(β) so that y is a minimal element of X \ [ {g(α) : α < β}, and hence we have that x /∈X \ [ {g(α : α < β}. In other words x ∈g(α) for some α < β and so f(x) = α < β = f(y). A relation R on a set A is said to be isomorphic to a relation S on a set B provided that there is a bijection f : A →B, called an isomorphism, such that for all x and y in A we have ⟨x, y⟩∈R iﬀ⟨f(x), f(y)⟩∈S. Exercise 17. Prove that any isomorphism between transitive sets is the identity. Of course, the relation on the transitive set is the membership relation, which is extensional and well founded. This unexpected result leads to the important Mostowski Collapsing The- orem. Theorem 20. Let R be a well founded extensional relation on a set X. There is a unique transitive set M and a unique isomorphism h : X →M. Proof. Obtain f : X →δ directly from the previous theorem. By recursion on the ordinals we deﬁne for each β < δ a function hβ : f ←{β} →V such that hβ(y) = {hα(x) : α < β and ⟨x, y⟩∈R}. Let h = S{hβ : β < δ}. Clearly h is a function with domain X. Note that if y ∈f ←{β} and ⟨x, y⟩∈R then x ∈f ←{α} for some α < β, so that in fact hβ(y) = {hα(x) : α < δ and ⟨x, y⟩∈R}, 56 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS and hence we have h(y) = {h(x) : ⟨x, y⟩∈R}. Since R is extensional, h is an injection. Letting M = mg(h), it is now straightforward to use the previous exercise to complete the proof. Exercise 18. Verify the last two sentences in this proof. We say that a relation R is a partial ordering or partial order whenever it is both irrefexive and transitive; if in addition it is total, then it is called a linear ordering or linear order; furthermore, if in addition it is well founded, then it is called a well ordering or well order. For those orderings we usually write < instead of R and we write x < y for ⟨x, y⟩∈R. Whenever ∃z z = ⟨X, <⟩and < is a partial ordering on X, we say that ⟨X, <⟩is a parially ordered set. We similarly have the concepts of linearly ordered set and well ordered set. The study of partially ordered sets continues to be a major theme in contemporary Set Theory and the construction of elaborate partial orders is of great technical importance. In contrast, well orders have been thoroughly analysed and we shall now classify all well ordered sets. Theorem 21. Each well ordered set is isomorphic to a unique ordinal. Proof. Since well orders are extensional and well founded we can use the Mostowski Collapsing Theorem. By Exercise 16 the resulting transitive set is an ordinal. The unique ordinal given by this theorem is called the order type of the well ordered set. We denote the order type of ⟨X, <⟩by type⟨X, <⟩. 57 We now come to the Well Ordering Principle, which is the fundamental theorem of Set Theory due to E. Zermelo. In order to prove it we use the Axiom of Choice and, for the ﬁrst time, the Power Set Axiom. Theorem 22. (∀X)(∃<) [⟨X, <⟩is a well ordered set]. Proof. We begin by using Theorem 5 to obtain a choice function f : P(X) \ {∅} →X such that for each nonempty A ⊆X we have f(A) ∈A. By recursion on ON we deﬁne g : ON →X ∪{X} as: g(β) = ( f(X \ {g(α) : α < β}), if X \ {g(α) : α < β} ̸= ∅; X, otherwise. (6.1) Now replace each x ∈X ∩ran(g) by the unique ordinal β such that g(β) = x. The Axiom of Replacement gives the resulting set S ⊆ON, where S = {β ∈ON : g(β) ∈X}. By Theorem 10 there is a δ ∈ON \ S. Choosing any such, we must have g(δ) /∈X; that is, g(δ) = X and so X ⊆{g(α) : α < δ}. It is now straightforward to verify that {⟨x, y⟩∈X × X : x = g(α) and y = g(β) for some α < β < δ} is a well ordering of X, which completes the proof. This Well Ordering Principle is used frequently in modem Set Theory. In fact, most uses of the Axiom of Choice are via the Well Ordering Principle. The Power Set Axiom, ﬁrst used in this proof, will now also be used frequently without special mention. 58 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND ORDERINGS Chapter 7 Cardinality In this chapter, we investigate a concept which aims to translate our intuitive notion of size into formal language. By Zermelo’s Well Ordering Principle (Theorem 22) every set can be well ordered. By Theorem 21, every well ordered set is isomorphic to an ordinal. Therefore, for any set x there is some ordinal κ ∈ON and a bijection f : x →κ. We deﬁne the cardinality of x, lxl, to be the least κ ∈ON such that there is some bijection f : x →κ. Every set has a cardinality. Those ordinals which are lxl for some x are called cardinals. Exercise 19. Prove that each n ∈ω is a cardinal and that ω is a cardinal. Show that ω + 1 is not a cardinal and that, in fact, each other cardinal is a limit ordinal. Theorem 23. The following are equivalent. 1. κ is a cardinal. 2. (∀α < κ)(¬∃bijection f : κ →α); i.e., lκl = κ. 3. (∀α < κ)(¬∃injection f : κ →α). 59 60 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY Proof. We prove the negations of each are equivalent: ¬(1) (∀x)[(∃bijection g: x →κ) →(∃α < κ)(∃bijection h: x →α)] ¬(2) ∃α < κ ∃bijection f : κ →α ¬(3) ∃α < κ ∃injection f : κ →α ¬(2) ⇒¬(1) Just take h = f ◦g. ¬(1) ⇒¬(3) Just consider x = κ. ¬(3) ⇒¬(2) Suppose α < κ and f : κ →α is an injection. By Theorem 21, there is an isomorphism g: β →f →κ for some β ∈ON. Since g is order preserving, we must have γ ≤g(γ) for each γ ∈β and hence β ≤α. Now g−1 ◦f : κ →β is the desired bijection. The following exercises are applications of the theorem. The ﬁrst two statements relate to the questions raised in the introduction. Exercise 20. Prove the following: 1. lxl = lyl iﬀ∃bijection f : x →y. 2. lxl ≤lyl iﬀ∃injection f : x →y. 3. lxl ≥lyl iﬀ∃surjection f : x →y. Assume here that y ̸= ∅. Theorem 24. (G. Cantor) ∀x lxl < lP(x)l. Proof. First note that if lxl ≥lP(x)l, then there would be a surjection g: x →P(x). But this cannot happen, since {a ∈x : a /∈g(a)} /∈g→(x). 61 For any ordinal α, we denote by α+ the least cardinal greater than α. This is well deﬁned by Theorem 24. Exercise 21. Prove the following: 1. The supremum of a set of cardinals is a cardinal. 2. ¬∃z z = {κ : κ is a cardinal}. Theorem 25. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, lκ × κl = κ. Proof. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. The formulas lκl = lκ × {0}l and lκ × {0}l ≤lκ × κl imply that κ ≤lκ × κl. We now show that lκ × κl ≤κ. We use induction and assume that lλ × λl = λ for each inﬁnite cardinal λ < κ. We deﬁne an ordering on κ × κ by: ⟨α0, β0⟩< ⟨α1, β1⟩iﬀ      max {α0, β0} < max {α1, β1}; max {α0, β0} = max {α1, β1} ∧α0 < α1; or, max {α0, β0} = max {α1, β1} ∧α0 = α1 ∧β0 < β1. It is easy to check that < well orders κ × κ. Let θ = type ⟨κ × κ, <⟩. It suﬃces to show that θ ≤κ. And for this it suﬃces to show that for all ⟨α, β⟩∈κ × κ, type ⟨<←{⟨α, β⟩}, <⟩< κ. To this end, pick ⟨α, β⟩∈κ×κ. Let δ ∈κ be such that <←{⟨α, β⟩} ⊆δ ×δ. This is possible since κ is a limit ordinal. It now suﬃces to prove that type ⟨<←{⟨δ, δ⟩}, <⟩< κ. By Theorem 23 it suﬃces to prove that l<←{⟨δ, δ⟩}l < κ and so it suﬃces to prove that lδ × δl < κ. Since lδ × δl = llδl × lδll, it suﬃces to prove that lλ × λl < κ for all cardinals λ < κ. If λ is inﬁnite, this is true by inductive hypothesis. If λ is ﬁnite, then lλ × λl < ω ≤κ. 62 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY Corollary. If X is inﬁnite, then lX × Y l = max {lXl, lY l}. Theorem 26. For any X we have l S Xl ≤max {lXl, sup {lal : a ∈X}}, provided that at least one element of X ∪{X} is inﬁnite. Proof. Let κ = sup {lal : a ∈X}. Using Exercise 20, for each a ∈X there is a surjection fa : κ →a. Deﬁne a surjection f : X × κ →S X by f(⟨a, α⟩) = fa(α). Using Exercise 20 and the previous corollary, the result follows. Deﬁne BA as {f : f : B →A} and [A]κ as {x : x ⊆A ∧lxl = κ}. Lemma. If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then lκκl = l[κ]κl = lP(κ)l. Proof. We have, κ2 ⊆ κκ ⊆[κ × κ]κ ⊆P(κ × κ). Using characteristic functions it is easily proved that lκ2l = lP(κ)l. Since lκ × κl = κ we have the result. Lemma. If κ ≤λ and λ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then lκλl = l[λ]κl. Proof. For each x ∈[λ]κ there is a bijection fx : κ →x. Since fx ∈ κλ, we have an injection from [λ]κ into κλ, so l[λ]κl ≤lκλl. Now κλ ⊆[κ × λ]κ. Thus, lκλl ≤l[λ]κl. A subset S of a limit ordinal α is said to be coﬁnal whenever sup S = α. A function f : δ →α is said to be coﬁnal whenever mg(f) is coﬁnal in α. The coﬁnality, cf(α), of a limit ordinal α is the least δ ∈ON such that there is a coﬁnal f : δ →α. 63 A cardinal κ is said to be regular whenever cf(κ) = κ. Otherwise, κ is said to be singular. These notions are of interest when κ is an inﬁnite cardinal. In particular, ω is regular. Lemma. 1. For each limit ordinal κ, cf(κ) is a regular cardinal. 2. For each limit ordinal κ, κ+ is a regular cardinal. 3. Each inﬁnite singular cardinal contains a coﬁnal subset of regular car- dinals. Exercise 22. Prove this lemma. Theorem 27. (K¨onig’s Theorem) For each inﬁnite cardinal κ, lcf(κ)κl > κ. Proof. We show that there is no surjection g: κ → δκ, where δ = cf(κ). Let f : δ →κ witness that cf(κ) = δ. Deﬁne h: δ →κ such that each h(α) /∈{g(β)(α) : β < f(α)}. Then h /∈g→(κ), since otherwise h = g(β) for some β < κ; pick α ∈δ such that f(α) > β. Corollary. For each inﬁnite cardinal κ, cf(lP(κ)l) > κ. Proof. Let λ = lP(κ)l. Suppose cf(λ) ≤κ. Then λ = lP(κ)l = lκ2l = l(κ×κ)2l = lκ(κ2)l = lκλl ≥lcf(λ)λl > λ. Cantor’s Theorem guarantees that for each ordinal α there is a set, P(α), which has cardinality greater than α. However, it does not imply, for exam- ple, that ω+ = lP(ω)l. This statement is called the Continuum Hypothesis, and is equivalent to the third question in the introduction. 64 CHAPTER 7. CARDINALITY The aleph function ℵ: ON →ON is deﬁned as follows: ℵ(0) = ω ℵ(α) = sup {ℵ(β)+ : β ∈α}. We write ℵα for ℵ(α). We also sometimes write ωα for ℵ(α). The beth function ℶ: ON →ON is deﬁned as follows: ℶ(0) = ω ℶ(α) = sup {lP(ℶ(β))l : β ∈α}. We write ℶβ for ℶ(β). It is apparent that ℵ1 ≤ℶ1. The continuum hypothesis is the statement ℵ1 = ℶ1; this is abbreviated as CH. The generalised continuum hypothesis, GCH, is the statement ∀α ∈ON ℵα = ℶα. Exercise 23. Prove that ∀κ [κ is an inﬁnite cardinal →(∃α ∈ON(κ = ℵα)]. A cardinal κ is said to be inaccessible whenever both κ is regular and ∀λ < κ lP(λ)l < κ. An inaccessible cardinal is sometimes said to be strongly inaccessible, and the term weakly inaccesible is given to a regular cardinal κ such that ∀λ < κ λ+ < κ. Under the GCH these two notions are equivalent. Axiom of Inaccessibles ∃κ κ > ω and κ is an inaccessible cardinal This axiom is a stronger version of the Axiom of Inﬁnity, but the mathemat- ical community is not quite ready to replace the Axiom of Inﬁnity with it just yet. In fact, the Axiom of Inacessibles is not included in the basic ZFC axiom system and is therefore always explicitly stated whenever it is used. Exercise 24. Are the following two statements true? What if κ is assumed to be a regular cardinal? 1. κ is weakly inaccessible iﬀκ = ℵκ. 2. κ is strongly inaccesssible iﬀκ = ℶκ. Chapter 8 There Is Nothing Real About The Real Numbers We now formulate three familiar number systems in the language of set the- ory. From the natural numbers we shall construct the integers; from the integers we shall construct the decimal numbers and the real numbers. For each n ∈N let −n = {{m} : m ∈n}. The integers, denoted by Z, are deﬁned as Z = N ∪{−n : n ∈N}. For each n ∈N \ {∅} we denote {n} by −n. We can extend the ordering < on N to Z by letting x < y iﬀone of the following holds: 1. x ∈N ∧y ∈N ∧x < y; 2. x /∈N ∧y ∈N; or, 3. x /∈N ∧y /∈N ∧S y < S x. To form the reals, ﬁrst let F = {f : f ∈ ωZ}. 65 66CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS We pose a few restrictions on such functions as follows. Let us write: A(f) for (∀n > 0)(−9 ≤f(n) ≤9); B(f) for (∀n ∈ω)(f(n) ≥0) ∨(∀n ∈ω)(f(n) ≤0); C(f) for (∀m ∈ω)(∃n ∈ω \ m)(f(n) /∈{9, −9}); and, D(f) for (∃m ∈ω)(∀n ∈ω \ m)(f(n) = 0). Finally, let R = {f : f ∈F and A(f) and B(f) ∧C(f)} to obtain the real numbers and let D = {f : f ∈R and D(f)} to obtain the decimal numbers. We now order R as follows: let f < g iﬀ (∃n ∈ω) [f(n) < g(n) ∧(∀m ∈n)(f(m) = g(m))]. This ordering clearly extends our ordering on N and Z, and restricts to D. In light of these deﬁnitions, the operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation deﬁned in Chapter 4 can be formally extended from N to Z, D and R in a natural—if cumbersome—fashion. Lemma. 1. lDl = ℵ0. 2. R is uncountable. 3. < is a linear order on D. 4. (∀p ∈R)(∀q ∈R) [p < q →∃d ∈D p < d < q]. I.e., D is a countable dense subset of R. 5. < is complete; i.e., bounded subsets have suprema and inﬁma. Exercise 25. Prove this lemma. Theorem 28. Any two countable dense linear orders without endpoints are isomorphic. 67 Proof. This method of proof, the back-and-forth argument, is due to G.Cantor. The idea is to deﬁne an isomorphism recursively in ω steps, such that at each step we have an order-preserving ﬁnite function; at even steps f(xi) is deﬁned and at odd steps f −1(yj) is deﬁned. Precisely, if X = {xi : i ∈ω} and Y = {yj : j ∈ω} are two countable dense linear orders we deﬁne f : X →Y by the formulas f0 = {⟨x0, y0⟩} fn+1 = fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} where 1. if n is even, i = min {k ∈ω : xk /∈dom(fn)} and j is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving; and, 2. if n is odd, j = min {k ∈ω : yk /∈mg(fn)} and i is chosen so that fn ∪{⟨xi, yj⟩} is order-preserving. We then check that for each n ∈ω, there is indeed a choice of j in (1) and i in (2) and that f = S{fn : n ∈ω} is an isomorphism. Any complete dense linear order without endpoints and with a countable dense subset is isomorphic to ⟨R, <⟩. Can “with a countable dense subset” be replaced by “in which every collection of disjoint intervals is countable”?. The aﬃrmation of this is called the Suslin Hypothesis. It is the second most important problem in Set Theory. It too requires new axioms for its solution. We have begun with N, extended to Z, then extended again to R. We now extend once more to ∗R. This is the set of hyperreals. In order to do this, we introduce the important notion of an ultraﬁlter. A collection of subsets U ⊆P(S) is a ﬁlter provided that it satisﬁes the ﬁrst three of the following conditions: 1. S ∈U and ∅/∈U. 68CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS 2. If A ∈U and B ∈U, then A ∩B ∈U. 3. If A ∈U and A ⊆B, then B ∈U. 4. A ∈U or B ∈U whenever A ∪B = S. 5. ∀x ∈S {x} /∈U. If a ﬁlter U obeys condition (4) it is called an ultraﬁlter, and if U satisﬁes conditions (1) through (5) it is said to be a free or non-principal ultraﬁlter. An ultraﬁlter is a maximal ﬁlter under inclusion. Every ﬁlter can be extended to an ultraﬁlter. (We can recursively deﬁne it.) There is a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Theorem 29. (Ramsey) If P : [ω]2 →{0, 1}, then there is H ∈[ω]ω such that lP ′′[H]2l = 1. Proof. Let U be a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Either: 1. {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 0} ∈U} ∈U; or, 2. {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 1} ∈U} ∈U. As such, the proof breaks into two similar cases. We address case (1). Let S = {α ∈ω : {β ∈ω : P({α, β}) = 0} ∈U}. Pick α0 ∈S and let S0 = {β ∈ω : P({α0, β}) = 0}. Pick α1 ∈S ∩S0 and let S1 = {β ∈ω : P({α1, β}) = 0}. In general, recursively choose {αn : n < ω} such that for each n αn+1 ∈S ∩S0 ∩· · · ∩Sn, 69 where Sn = {β ∈ω : P({αn, β}) = 0}. Then H = {αn : n < ω} exhibits the desired property. Theorem 30. (Sierpinski) There is a function P : [ω1]2 →{0, 1} such that there is no H ∈[ω1]ω1 with lP ′′[H]2l = 1. Proof. Let f : ω1 →R be an injection. Deﬁne P as follows: for α < β, let P({α, β}) = ( 0, if f(α) < f(β); 1, if f(α) > f(β). (8.1) The following exercise ﬁnishes the proof. Exercise 26. There is no subset of R with order type ω1. Let U be a free ultraﬁlter over ω. Form an equivalence relation ∼on ωR by the rule: f ∼g whenever {n ∈ω : f(n) = g(n)} ∈U. The equivalence class of f is denoted by [f] = {g ∈ ωR : g ∼f}. The set of equivalence classes of ∼is called the ultrapower of R with respect to U. The elements of ωR are often called the hyperreal numbers and denoted ∗R. There is a natural embedding of R into ∗R given by x 7→[fx] where fx : ω →R is the constant function; i.e., fx(n) = x for all n ∈ω; we identify R with its image under the natural embedding. 70CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS We can deﬁne an ordering ∗< on ∗R by the rule: a <∗b whenever ∃f ∈a ∃g ∈b {n ∈ω : f(n) < g(n)} ∈U. Lemma. ∗< is a linear ordering on ∗R which extends the usual ordering of R. Exercise 27. Prove this lemma. We usually omit the asterisk, writing < for ∗<. Exercise 28. There is a subset of ∗R of order type ω1. For each function F : Rn →R there is a natural extension ∗F : (∗R)n → ∗R given by ∗F(⃗a) = [F ◦⃗s] where ⃗a = ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩∈(∗R)n and ⃗s: ω →Rn such that for each j ∈ω ⃗s(j) = ⟨s0(j), . . . , sn−1(j)⟩ and si ∈ai for each i. Theorem 31. (The Leibniz Transfer Principle) Suppose F : Rn →R and G: Rn →R. 1. ∀⃗a ∈Rn F(⃗a) = G(⃗a) iﬀ∀⃗a ∈(∗R)n ∗F(⃗a) = ∗G(⃗a). 2. ∀⃗a ∈Rn F(⃗a) < G(⃗a) iﬀ∀⃗a ∈(∗R)n ∗F(⃗a) < ∗G(⃗a). Exercise 29. Prove the above theorem. This includes verifying that ∗F is a function. As a consequence of this theorem, we can extend + and × to ∗R. For example, a + b = c means that ∃f ∈a ∃g ∈b ∃h ∈c {n ∈ω : f(n) + g(n) = h(n)} ∈U. 71 Indeed, the natural embedding embeds R as an ordered subﬁeld of ∗R. In order to do elementary calculus we consider the inﬁnitesimal elements of ∗R. Note that R ̸= ∗R; consider α = [⟨1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . , 1/n, . . . ⟩]. Then α > 0 but α < r for each positive r ∈R; a member of ∗R with this property is called a positive inﬁnitesimal. There are negative inﬁnitesimals; 0 is an inﬁnitesimal. Since ∗R is a ﬁeld 1/α exists and 1/α > r for any real number r; it is an example of a positive inﬁnite number. A hyperreal number a is said to be ﬁnite whenever lal < r for some real r. Two hyperreal numbers a and b are said to be inﬁnitely close whenever a −b is inﬁnitesimal. We write a ≈b. Lemma. Each ﬁnite hyperreal number is inﬁnitely close to a unique real number. Proof. Let a be ﬁnite. Let s = sup {r ∈R : r < a}. Then a ≈s. If we also have another real t such that a ≈t, then we have s ≈t and so s = t. If a is ﬁnite, the standard part of a, st(a), is deﬁned to be the unique real number which is inﬁnitely close to a. It is easy to check that for ﬁnite a and b, st(a + b) = st(a) + st(b); and, st(a × b) = st(a) × st(b). For a function F : R →R we deﬁne the derivative, F ′(x), of F(x) to be st F(x + △x) −F(x) △x  provided this exists and is the same for each non-zero inﬁnitesimal △x. 72CHAPTER 8. THERE IS NOTHING REAL ABOUT THE REAL NUMBERS The fact that F ′(x) exists implies that for each inﬁnitesimal △x there is an inﬁnitesimal ϵ such that F(x + △x) = F(x) + F ′(x)△x + ϵ△x. That is, for any △x ≈0 there is some ϵ ≈0 such that △y = F ′(x)△x + ϵ△x where △y = F(x + △x) −F(x). Theorem 32. (The Chain Rule) Suppose y = F(x) and x = G(t) are diﬀerentiable functions. Then y = F(G(t)) is diﬀerentiable and has derivative F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Proof. Let △t be any non-zero inﬁnitesimal. Let △x = G(t + △t) −G(t). Since G′(x) exists, △x is inﬁnitesimal. Let △y = F(x + △x) −F(x). We wish to calculate st( △y △x), which will be the derivative of y = F(G(t)). We consider two cases. Case 0: △x = 0 △y = 0, st(△y △t ) = 0, and G′(t) = st(△x △t ) = 0. So st(△y △t ) = F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Case 1: △x ̸= 0 △y △t = △y △x · △x △t . So st(△y △t ) = st( △y △x) · st(△x △t ), and again, st(△y △t ) = F ′(x) · G′(t) = F ′(G(t)) · G′(t). Chapter 9 The Universe In this chapter we shall discuss two methods of measuring the complexity of a set, as well as their corresponding gradations of the universe. For this discussion it will be helpful to develop both a new induction and a new recursion procedure, this time on the whole universe. Each of these will depend upon the fact that every set is contained in a transitive set, which we now prove. By recursion on N, we deﬁne: [ 0X = X; and, [ n+1X = [ ( [ nX). We deﬁne the transitive closure of X as, trcl(X) = [ { [ nX : n ∈ω}. Theorem 33. 1. ∀X trcl(X) is the smallest transitive set containing X. 2. ∀x trcl(x) = x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}. Proof. Note that Y is transitive iﬀS Y ⊆Y , so trcl(X) is transitive. 73 74 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE 1. If Y is transitive and X ⊆Y then for each n ∈N, S nX ⊆S nY ⊆Y . So trcl(X) ⊆Y . 2. To prove that trcl(x) ⊇x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}, notice ﬁrst that since ∀y ∈x y ⊆S x, we have that ∀n ∈ω S ny ⊆S n+1x. Hence trcl(y) ⊆trcl(x). For the opposite containment, we prove by induction that ∀n ∈ω S nx ⊆x ∪S{trcl(y) : y ∈x}. As with N and ON, we can perform induction on the universe, called ∈−induction, as illustrated by the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ(v, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 34. Φ For all ⃗w, if ∀n [(∀m ∈n Φ(m, ⃗w)) →Φ(n, ⃗w)] then ∀n Φ(n, ⃗w). Proof. We shall assume that the theorem is false and derive a contradiction. We have ⃗w and a ﬁxed l such that ¬Φ(l, ⃗w). Let t be any transitive set containing l. Thanks to the previous theorem, we can let t = trcl(l ∪{l}). The proof now proceeds verbatim as the proofs of Theorems 8 and 13. We can also carry out recursive deﬁnitions on V; this is called ∈−recursion. For any formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory, we denote by REC(Φ, V) the class {⟨x, y⟩: (∃n)(∃f) [f : n →V ∧f(x) = y ∧∀m ∈n Φ(m, flm, f(m), ⃗w)]}. ∈−recursion is justiﬁed by the next theorem scheme. 75 For each formula Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 35. Φ For all ⃗w, suppose that we have (∀x)(∀f) [(f : x →V) →∃!y Φ(x, f, y, ⃗w)]. Then, letting F denote REC(Φ, V), we have: 1. F : V →V; 2. ∀x Φ(x, Flx, F(x), ⃗w); and furthermore for any n and any function H with n ∈dom(H) we have, 3. Φ(x, Hlx, H(x), ⃗w) for all x ∈n ∪{n} then H(n) = F(n). Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorems 9 and 14. Our ﬁrst new measure of the size of a set is given by the rank function. This associates, to each set x, an ordinal rank(x) by the following rule: rank(x) = sup {rank(y) + 1 : y ∈x} Observe that ∀α ∈ON rank(α) = α. By recursion on ON we deﬁne the cumulative hierarchy, an ordinal-gradation on V, as follows. R(0) = ∅; R(α + 1) = P(R(α)); and, R(δ) = [ {R(α) : α < δ} if δ is a limit ordinal. Sometimes we write Rα or Vα for R(α). The next theorem connects and lists some useful properties of the cumulative hierarchy and the rank function. Theorem 36. 76 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE 1. ∀α ∈ON R(α) is transitive. 2. ∀α ∈ON ∀β ∈ON (β < α →R(β) ⊆R(α). 3. ∀x ∀α ∈ON (x ∈R(α) ↔∃β ∈α x ⊆R(β)). 4. ∀x ∀α ∈ON (x ∈R(α + 1) \ R(α) ↔rank(x) = α). 5. ∀x ∃α ∈ON x ∈R(α); i.e., V = S{R(α) : α ∈ON}. Proof. 1. This is an easy induction on α ∈ON. 2. Apply induction on α, using (1). 3. (→) Note that if γ is least ordinal such that x ∈R(γ), then γ is a successor ordinal, so choose β such that γ = β + 1; (←) This uses (2). 4. First show by induction on α that rank(x) < α implies x ∈R(α). 5. This follows from ∀x ∃α ∈ON rank(x) = α. We have discussed cardinality as a way of measuring the size of a set. However, if our set is not transitive, the cardinality function does not tell the whole story since it cannot distinguish the elements of the set. For example, although N ∈{N}, lNl = ℵ0 while l{N}l = 1. Intuitively, we think of {N} as no smaller than N. As such, we deﬁne the hereditary cardinality, hcard(x), of a set x, as the cardinality of its transitive closure: hcard(x) = ltrcl(x)l The corresponding cardinal-gradation is deﬁned as follows. For each cardinal κ, H(κ) = {x : ltrcl(x) < κ}. 77 The members of H(ω) are called the hereditarily ﬁnite sets and the members of H(ω1) are called the hereditarily countable sets. The next theorem lists some important properties of H. Theorem 37. 1. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, H(κ) is transitive. 2. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, ∀x hcard(x) < κ →rank(x) < κ. 3. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, H(κ) ⊆R(κ). 4. For any inﬁnite cardinal κ, ∃z z = H(κ). 5. ∀x ∃κ (κ is a cardinal and x ∈H(κ)); i.e, V = S{H(κ) : κ is a cardinal}. Proof. 1. Apply part (2) of Theorem 33. 2. Case 1: κ is regular. The proof is by ∈-induction on V, noting that if rank(y) < κ for each y ∈x and lxl < κ, then rank(x) < κ. Case 2: κ is singular. There is a regular cardinal λ such that hcard(x) < λ < κ; now use Case 1. 3. This follows from (2) and Theorem 36. 4. Apply (3) and Comprehension. 5. This follows since ∀x ∃κ hcard(x) = κ. Theorem 38. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then H(κ) = R(κ). 78 CHAPTER 9. THE UNIVERSE Proof. From Theorem 37 we have H(κ) ⊆R(κ). For the reverse containment, let x ∈R(κ). By Theorem 36, ∃α < κ such that x ∈R(α + 1) \ R(α). So x ⊆R(α). Since R(α) is transitive, trcl(x) ⊆R(α). It suﬃces to prove by induction that ∀α < κ lR(α)l < κ. For successor α = β + 1, we note that lP(λ)l < κ, where λ = lR(β)l; for limit α we apply Theorem 36, observing that κ is regular. Chapter 10 Reﬂection There is a generalisation of the Equality Axiom, called the Equality Principle, which states that for any formula Φ we have x = y implying that Φ holds at x iﬀΦ holds at y. The proof requires a new technique, called induction on complexity of the formula. We make this precise. For each formula Φ of set theory all of whose free variables lie among v0, . . . , vn we write Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and for each i and j with 0 ≤i ≤n, we denote by Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) the result of substituting vj for each free occurance of vi. For each formula Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and each i and j with 0 ≤i ≤n we have: Theorem 39. Φ, i, j ∀v0 . . . ∀vi . . . ∀vn∀vj[vi = vj →(Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔(Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))] This is a scheme of theorems, one for each appropriate Φ, i, j. Proof. The proof will come in two steps. 1. We ﬁrst prove this for atomic formulas Φ. 79 80 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION Case 1 Φ is vi ∈vk where i ̸= k This is true by Axiom of Equality. Case 2 Φ is vk ∈vi where i ̸= k This is true by Axiom of Extensionality. Case 3 Φ is vi ∈vi This is true since by Theorem 2 both vi ∈vj and vj ∈vi are false. Case 4 Φ is vk ∈vk where i ̸= k This is true since both Φ(v0, . . . , vn) and Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) are the same. Case 5 Φ is vi = vk where i ̸= k This is true by Theorem 1. Case 6 Φ is vk = vi where i ̸= k This is similar to case 5. Case 7 Φ is vi = vi This is true since by Theorem 1 both vi = vi and vj = vj are true. Case 8 Φ is vk = vk where i ̸= k This is similar to case 4. 2. We now show that for any subformula Ωof Φ, if the theorem is true for all proper subformulas of Ωthen it is true for Ω. Here Θ and Ψ are subformulas of Ωand Ωis expressed in parentheses for each case according to how Ωis built. Case 1 (¬Θ) This is true since if Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) then ¬Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔¬Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) Case 2 (Θ ∧Ψ) From the hypothesis that Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) and Ψ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Ψ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) 81 we obain Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ∧Ψ(v0, . . . , vn) iﬀ Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) ∧Ψ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn). Cases 3 through 5 result from Cases 1 and 2. Case 3 (Θ ∨Ψ) Case 4 (Θ →Ψ) Case 5 (Θ ↔Ψ) Case 6 (∀vk Θ) and i ̸= k We have ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn)]. If vk is not free in Θ, then Θ ↔∀vk Θ and we are done. If vk is free in Θ, then since 0 ≤k ≤n we have ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj ∀vk [vi = vj →Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn)] and so ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →(∀vk)(Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))] and so ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ∀vj [vi = vj →(∀vk)Θ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔(∀vk)Θ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn))]. Case 7 (∃vk) Θ) and i ̸= k This follows from Cases 1 and 6. Case 8 (∀vi Θ) This is true since vi is not free in Φ, hence Φ(v0, . . . , vi/vj, . . . , vn) is Φ(v0, . . . , vn). 82 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION Case 9 (∃vi) Θ) This is similar to case 8. We conclude that the theorem scheme holds for all appropriate Φ, i, j. Let M be a term and Φ any formula of the language of set theory. We deﬁne the relativisation of Φ to M, denoted by ΦM, as follows: 1. If Φ is atomic then ΦM is Φ; 2. If Φ is ¬Ψ then ΦM is ¬ΨM; 3. If Φ is (Ψ1 ∧Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ∧ΨM 2 ); 4. If Φ is (Ψ1 ∨Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ∨ΨM 2 ); 5. If Φ is (Ψ1 →Ψ2) then ΦM is (ΨM 1 →ΨM 2 ); 6. If Φ is (Ψ1 ↔Ψ2); then ΦM is (ΨM 1 ↔ΨM 2 ); 7. If Φ is (∀vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∀vi ∈M)ΨM; and, 8. If Φ is (∃vi)Ψ then ΦM is (∃vi ∈M)ΨM. We write M l= Φ for ΦM and moreover whenever Φ has no free variables we say that M is a model of Φ. We denote by ZFC the collection of axioms which include: Equality, Extensionality, Existence, Pairing, Foundation, Union, Intersection, the Re- placement Scheme, Power Set, Choice and Inﬁnity. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for the Axiom of Inﬁnity, we have: Lemma. Φ R(ω) l= Φ. 83 Lemma. If M is transitive, then M models Equality, Extensionality, Exis- tence and Foundation. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for those in the Replacement Scheme, we have: Theorem 40. For each uncountable κ, R(κ) l= Φ. Exercise 30. Prove the above theorem scheme. Use the fact that V l= Φ. For each axiom Φ of ZFC, except for Power Set, we have: Theorem 41. For each uncountable regular cardinal κ, H(κ) l= Φ. Exercise 31. Prove the above theorem scheme. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then R(κ) = H(κ) l= Φ, for each axiom Φ of ZFC. Lemma. If κ is the least inaccessible cardinal, then H(κ) l= ¬∃an inaccessible cardinal. From this lemma we can infer that there is no proof, from ZFC, that there is an inaccessible cardinal. Suppose Θ is the conjuction of all the (ﬁnitely many) axioms used in such a proof. Then from Θ we can derive (∃λ)(λ is an inaccessible). Let κ be the least inaccessible cardinal. Then H(κ) l= Θ so H(κ) l= (∃λ)(λ is an inaccessible). This assumes that our proof system is sound; i.e., if from Θ1 we can derive Θ2 and M l= Θ1, then M l= Θ2. We conclude that ZFC plus “¬∃an inaccessible” is consistent. We can also infer that ZFC minus “Inﬁnity” plus “¬(∃z)(z = N)” is consistent. Suppose not. Suppose Θ is the conjuction of the ﬁnitely many axioms of ZFC −Inf needed to prove (∃z)(z = N). Then H(ω) l= Θ, so H(ω) l= (∃z)(z = N), which is a contradiction. 84 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION In fact, given any collection of formulas without free variables and a class M such that for each Φ in the collection M l= Φ, we can then conclude that the collection is consistent. For example, ZFC minus “Power Set” plus “(∀x)(x is countable)” is con- sistent: Lemma. H(ω1) l= (∀x)(x is countable). If Φ(v0, . . . , vk) is a formula of the language of set theory and M = {x : χM(x,⃗v)} and C = {x : χC(x,⃗v)} are classes, then we say Φ is absolute between M and C whenever (∀v0 ∈M ∩C) . . . (∀vk ∈M ∩C) [ΦM ↔ΦC]. This concept is most often used when M ⊆C. When C = V, we say that Φ is absolute for M. For classes M = {x : χM(x,⃗v)} and C = {x : χC(x,⃗v)} with M ⊆C and a list Φ0, . . . , Φm of formulas of set theory such that for each i ≤m every subformula of Φi is contained in the list, we have: Lemma. χM, χC, Φ1, . . . , Φm The following are equivalent: 1. Each of Φ1, . . . , Φm are absolute between M and C. 2. Whenever Φi is ∃x Φj(x,⃗v) for i, j ≤m we have (∀v1 ∈M . . . ∀vk ∈M)(∃x ∈C ΦC j (x,⃗v) →∃x ∈M ΦC j (x,⃗v)). The latter statement is called the Tarski-Vaught Condition. Proof. ((1) ⇒(2)) 85 Let v0 ∈M, . . . , vk ∈M and suppose ∃x ∈C ΦC j (x, v0, . . . , vk). Then ΦC i (v0, . . . , vk) holds. By absoluteness ΦM i (v0, . . . , vk) holds; i.e., ∃x ∈M ΦM j (x, v0, . . . , vk), so by absoluteness of Φj(x, v0, . . . , vk) for x ∈M we have ∃x ∈M ΦC j (x, v0, . . . , vk). (2) ⇒(1) This is proved by induction on complexity of Φi, noting that each sub- formula appears in the list. There is no problem with the atomic formula step since atomic formulas are always absolute. Similarly, the negation and connective steps are easy. Now if Φi is ∃x Φj and each of v1, . . . , vk is in M we have ΦM i (v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈M ΦM j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈M ΦC j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔∃x ∈C ΦC j (x, v1, . . . , vk) ⇔ΦC i (v1, . . . , vk) where the second implication is due to the inductive hypothesis and the third implication is by part (2). The next theorem scheme is called the Levy Reﬂection Principle. For each formula Φ of the language of set theory, we have: Theorem 42. Φ ∀α ∈ON ∃β ∈ON [β > α and Φ is absolute for R(β)]. If, in addition, Φ has no free variables then Φ implies R(β) l= Φ. This is interpreted as the truth of Φ being reﬂected to R(β). Proof. Form a collection Φ1, . . . , Φm of all the subformulas of Φ. We will use the Tarski-Vaught Condition for Φ1, . . . , Φm to get absoluteness between R(β) and V; but ﬁrst we must ﬁnd β. 86 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION For each i = 1, . . . , m such that Φi is ∃x Ψ for some formula Ψ we deﬁne fi such that fi : V →ON by setting fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) = min {γ : γ ∈ON ∧∃x ∈R(γ) Ψ(x, y1, . . . , yli)} if such an ordinal exists, and fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) = α otherwise. Now deﬁne h: ω →ON by recursion by the formulas h(0) = α h(n + 1) = sup {fi(⟨y1, . . . , yli⟩) : 1 ≤i < m and each yj ∈R(h(n))} and then let β = sup {h(n) : n ∈ω}. This β works. The analogous theorem scheme can be proven for the H(κ) hierarchy as well. We can now argue that ZFC cannot be ﬁnitely axiomatised. That is, there is no one formula without free variables which implies all axioms of ZFC and is, in tum, implied by ZFC. Suppose such a Φ exists. By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, choose the least β ∈ON such that ΦR(β). We have R(β) l= Φ. Hence R(β) l= ∃α ∈ON ΦR(α), since this instance of the theorem follows from ZFC. Thus, (∃α ∈ON ΦR(α))R(β). That is, ∃α ∈(ON ∩R(β)) ΦR(α)∩R(β). But ON ∩R(β) = β, the ordinals of rank < β. So, α < β and we have ∃α < β ΦR(α), contradicting the minimality of β. For any formula Φ of the language of set theory with no free variables and classes M = {v : χM(v)}, C = {v : χC(v)}, and F = {v : χF(v)} we have: Lemma. Φ, χM, χC, χF If F : M →C is an isomorphism then Φ is absolute between M and C. That is, M l= Φ iﬀC l= Φ. 87 Proof. It is easy to show by induction on the complexity of Φ that Ψ(x1, . . . , xk) ⇔Ψ(F(x1), . . . , F(xk)) for each subformula Ψ of Φ. A bounded formula (also called a △0 formula) is one which is built up as usual with respect to atomic formulas and connectives, but where each ∃x Φ clause is replaced by ∃x ∈y Φ, and the ∀x Φ clause is replaced by ∀x ∈y Φ. △0 formulas are absolute for transitive models. That is, for each △0 formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w) and for each class M = {x : χM(x, ⃗w)} we have: Theorem 43. Φ, χM ∀⃗w if M is transitive, then (∀v0 ∈M) . . . (∀vk ∈M) [ΦM(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w) ↔Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)] Proof. We use induction on the complexity of Φ. We only show the ∃step. Suppose [(∀v0 ∈M) . . . (∀vk ∈M) ΦM(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)] ↔Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w). We wish to consider (∃vi ∈vj) Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w). Fix any v0, . . . , vk ∈M, but not vi; however, vj is ﬁxed in M. Now (∃vi ∈vj Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w))M →(∃vi ∈vj Φ(v0, . . . , vk, ⃗w)) since ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) →Φ(⃗v, ⃗w). Also, (∃vi ∈vj) Φ(⃗v, ⃗w) →(∃vi ∈vj) ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) since Φ(⃗v, ⃗w) →ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) →∃vi ∈(vj ∩M) ΦM(⃗v, ⃗w) since vj ∈M implies vj ⊆M →((∃vi ∈vj) Φ(⃗v, ⃗w))M 88 CHAPTER 10. REFLECTION A formula Φ(⃗w) is said to be △T 1 , where T is a subcollection of ZFC, whenever there are △0 formulas Φ1(⃗v, ⃗w) and Φ2(⃗v, ⃗w) such that using only the axioms from T we can prove that both: (∀⃗w)(Φ1(⃗w) ↔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Φ1(⃗v, ⃗w)) (∀⃗w)(Φ2(⃗w) ↔∀v0 . . . ∀vk Φ2(⃗v, ⃗w)). We can now use the above theorem to show that if Φ(⃗w) is a △T 1 formula and M l= Θ for each Θ in T, then Φ(⃗w) is absolute for M, whenever M is transitive. We do so as follows, letting Ψ play the role of Ψ1 above: Φ(⃗w) ⇔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w) ⇔(∃v0 ∈M) . . . (∃vk ∈M) [Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w)] ⇔∃v0 . . . ∃vk Ψ(⃗v, ⃗w)M ⇔Φ(⃗w)M The ﬁrst and third implications accrue from Φ(⃗w) being △T 1 ; the second from the fact that Ψ is △0 and M is transitive and models the axioms of T. This is often used with T as ZFC without Power Set and M = H(κ). Chapter 11 Elementary Submodels In this chapter we shall ﬁrst introduce a collection of set operations proposed by Kurt G¨odel which are used to build sets. We shall then discuss the new concept of elementary submodel. We now deﬁne the ordered n−tuple with the following inﬁnitely many formulas, thereby extending the notion of ordered pair. ⟨x⟩= x ⟨x, y⟩= {{x}, {x, y}} ⟨x, y, z⟩= ⟨⟨x, y⟩, z⟩ ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩= ⟨⟨x1, . . . , xn−1⟩, xn⟩ The following operations shuﬄe the components of such tuples in a set S. F0(S) = {⟨⟨u, v⟩, w⟩: ⟨u, ⟨v, w⟩⟩∈S} F1(S) = {⟨u, ⟨v, w⟩⟩: ⟨⟨u, v⟩, w⟩∈S} F2(S) = {⟨v, u⟩: ⟨u, v⟩∈S} F3(S) = {⟨v, u, w⟩: ⟨u, v, w⟩∈S} F4(S) = {⟨t, v, u, w⟩: ⟨t, u, v, w⟩∈S} Lemma. (Shuﬄe Lemma Scheme) 89 90 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS For any m ∈N and any permutation σ: m →m, there is a composition of the operations F0, F1, F2, F3, F4 such that for any S, Fσ(S) = {⟨xσ(0), . . . , xσ(m−1)⟩: ⟨x0, . . . , xm−1⟩∈S}. Proof. Since binary exchanges generate the symmetric group, noting that the identity permutation is given by F2 ◦F2, it suﬃces to consider only σ such that for some l ≤m, σ(i) =      i + 1, if i = l; i −1, if i = l + 1; i, otherwise. For convenience, let F n i denote the n−fold composition of Fi. There are several cases. Case 1: m = 2 Fσ = F2 Case 2: m = 3, l = 1 Fσ = F3 Case 3: m = 3, l = 2 Fσ = F0 ◦F2 ◦F3 ◦F2 ◦F1 Case 4: m ≥4, l = 1 Fσ = F m−3 0 ◦F3 ◦F m−3 1 Case 5: m ≥4, 1 ≤l ≤m −1 Fσ = F m−l−2 0 ◦F4 ◦F m−l−2 1 Case 6: m ≥4, l = m −1 Fσ = F0 ◦F2 ◦F3 ◦F2 ◦F1 The G¨odel Operations are as follows: 91 G1(X, Y ) = {X, Y } G2(X, Y ) = X \ Y G3(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y }; i.e., X × Y G4(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧u = v} G5(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧u ∈v} G6(X, Y ) = {⟨u, v⟩: u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧v ∈u} G7(X, R) = {u : ∃x ∈X ⟨u, x⟩∈R} G8(X, R) = {u : ∀x ∈X ⟨u, x⟩∈R} G9(X, R) = F0(R) G10(X, R) = F1(R) G11(X, R) = F2(R) G12(X, R) = F3(R) G13(X, R) = F4(R) G9 through G13 are deﬁned as binary operations for conformity. We now construct a function which, when coupled with recursion on ON, will enumerate all possible compositions of G¨odel operations. G: N×V →V is given by the following rule. For each k ∈ω and each ⃗s: k →V, we deﬁne GlN×⃗s by recursion on N as follows: G(n,⃗s) =      ⃗s(i), if n = 17i, 0 ≤i ≤k; Gm(G(i,⃗s), G(j,⃗s)), if n = m · 19i+123j+1, 1 ≤m ≤13; ∅, otherwise. — Now G enumerates all compositions of G¨odel operations. We wish to prove that sets deﬁned by △0 formulas can be obtained through a composition of G¨odel operations. First we need a lemma. Lemma. Each of the following sets is equal to a composition of G¨odel oper- ations on X, ⃗w. 92 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS 1. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧wi = wj} 2. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧wi ∈wj} 3. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧wi = xj} 4. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧wi ∈xj} 5. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧xi ∈wj} 6. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧xi = xj} 7. {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X ∧xi ∈xj} Proof. First note that {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X} = G3(G3 . . . (G3(X, X), . . . X), X) where G3 is composed (m −1)−fold; i.e., (. . . ((X × X) × X) × · · · × X). Now call this set Pm(X), the mth power of X. Let us now examine each of the seven cases individually. 1. This is either Pm(X) or ∅depending upon whether or not wi = wj. 2. This is either Pm(X) or ∅depending upon whether or not wi ∈wj. 3. If m = 1, then this set is ⟨wi⟩= wi. For m > 1, we may, thanks to the Shuﬄe Lemma, without loss of generality assume that j = m. The set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), wi) if wi ∈X and ∅otherwise. 4. Again, without loss of generality, we assume j = m. This set is equal to G3(Pm−1(X), G7(X, G6(X, {wi}))). 5. Again, assume j = m. This set is given by G3(Pm−1(X), G7(X, G5(X, {wi}))). 93 6. This time, assume i = m −1 and j = m. This set is G3(Pm−2(X), G4(X, X)). 7. We assume again that i = m −1 and j = m. This set becomes G3(Pm−2(X), G5(X, X)). For each formula Φ(x, ⃗w) of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 44. Φ (∀⃗w)(∀X)(∃n ∈ω) [{x ∈X : ΦX(x, ⃗w)} = G(n,⃗s)] where ⃗s(i) = wi for i < k and s(k) = X. Proof. We prove by induction on the complexity of Φ that for all m ∈ω and Φ (∀⃗w)(∃n ∈ω)[{⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX(x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n,⃗s)] The proof of the theorem for any given Φ will assume the corresponding result for a ﬁnite number of simpler formulas, the proper subformulas of Φ. We begin by looking at atomic formulas Φ. This step is covered by the previous lemma. Now we proceed by induction on complexity. Suppose that {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX 1 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n1,⃗s) and {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm ∈X and ΦX 2 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n2,⃗s). 94 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Then {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X . . . xm ∈X and ¬ΦX 1 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = Pm(X) \ G(n1,⃗s) = G2(Pm(X), G(n1,⃗s)) and {⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩: x1 ∈X . . . xm ∈X and ΦX 1 ∧ΦX 2 (x1, . . . , xm, ⃗w)} = G(n1,⃗s) ∩G(n2,⃗s). The other connectives can be formed from ¬ and ∧; as such, ∀xl is ¬∃xl, so it only remains to do the Φ = ∃xl Φ1 step. Thanks again to the last lemma, we may assume that l = m. Then Φ is ∃xm Φ1 and {⟨x1 . . . xm−1⟩: x1 ∈X ∧· · · ∧xm−1 ∈X and ΦX(x1, . . . , xm−1, ⃗w)} = G7(G(n1,⃗s)) Let’s write G(n, X, ⃗y) for G(n,⃗s), where ⃗s(0) = X and ⃗s(k + 1) = ⃗y(k) for all k ∈dom(⃗y) = dom(⃗s) −1. M is said to be an elementary submodel of N whenever 1. M ⊆N; and, 2. ∀k ∈ω ∀⃗y ∈ kM ∀n ∈ω G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅⇔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅. We write M ≺N. Justiﬁcation of the terminology comes from the following theorem scheme. For each formula Φ of the language of set theory we have: Theorem 45. Φ Suppose M ≺N. Then Φ is absolute between M and N. 95 Proof. We will use the Tarski-Vaught criterion. Let Φ0, . . . , Φm enumer- ate Φ and each of its subformulas. Suppose Φi is ∃x Φj(x, y0, . . . , yk) with y0, . . . , yk ∈M in a sequence ⃗y. Let n ∈ω so that by Theorem 44 we can ﬁnd n ∈ω such that G(n, N, ⃗y) = {x ∈N : ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk)}. Then ∃x ∈N ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk) ↔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅ ↔G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅ ↔∃x ∈M ΦN j (x, y0, . . . , yk). The following is sometimes called the Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski theorem. Theorem 46. Suppose X ⊆N. Then there is an M such that 1. M ≺N; 2. X ⊆M; and, 3. lMl ≤max{ω, lXl}. Proof. Deﬁne F : ω × S{kN : k ∈ω} →N by choice: F(n,⃗s) = ( some element of G(n, N,⃗s) if G(n, N,⃗s) ̸= ∅ any element of N otherwise Now deﬁne {Xn}n∈ω by recursion on N as follows: X0 = X Xm+1 = Xm ∪F ′′(ω × [ {k(Xm) : k ∈ω}) 96 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Let M = S m∈ω Xm. As such, (2) and (3) are clearly satisﬁed. To check (1), let ⃗y ∈ k(Xm). If G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩N ̸= ∅, then F(n, ⃗y) ∈Xm+1 ⊆M and G(n, N, ⃗y) ∩M ̸= ∅. The use of elementary submodels of the H(θ) can be illustrated. Theorem 47. (Pressing Down Lemma) Let f : ω1 \ {0} →ω1 be regressive; i.e., f(α) < α for all α. Then ∃β ∈ω1 such that f ←{β} is uncountable. Theorem 48. (Delta System Lemma) Let A be an uncountable collection of ﬁnite sets. Then ∃D ⊆A ∃R such that 1. D is uncountable, and 2. ∀D1, D2 ∈D D1 ∩D2 = R. We need some lemmas. Assume M ≺H(θ) where θ is an uncountable regular cardinal. For each △0 formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk) we have: Lemma. Φ (∀y0 ∈M) . . . (∀yk ∈M) [M l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) ⇔Φ(y0, . . . , yk)]. Proof. M l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) ⇔H(θ) l= Φ(y0, . . . , yk) by elementarity, ⇔Φ(y0, . . . , yk) since H(θ) is transitive. 97 Remark. The same is true for △T 1 formulas where T is ZFC without Power Set. For any formula Φ(v0, . . . , vk) of LOST, we have: Lemma. Φ ∀y0 ∈M ∀y2 ∈M . . . ∀yk ∈M ∀x ∈H(θ) [H(θ) l= z = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} →z ∈M]. Proof. Let y0, . . . , yk ∈M and z ∈H(θ) be given such that H(θ) l= z = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)}. Then, H(θ) l= ∃u u = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒M l= ∃u u = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒∃p ∈M [M l= p = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)}] ⇒H(θ) l= p = {x : Φ(x, y0, . . . , yk)} ⇒H(θ) l= p = z. H(θ) is transitive; therefore, p = z and hence z ∈M. Corollaries. 1. If M ≺H(θ), then (a) ∅∈M; (b) ω ∈M; and, (c) ω ⊆M. 2. If also θ > ω1, then ω1 ∈M. Proof. ∅and ω are direct. For ω ⊆M show that y ∈M ⇒y ∪{y} ∈M. 98 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS Lemma. Suppose M ≺H(θ) where θ is regular and uncountable. Suppose p is countable and p ∈M. Then p ⊆M. Proof. Let q ∈p; we must show that q ∈M. Let f0 : ω →p be a surjection. Since {ω, p} ⊂H(θ) we must have f0 ∈H(θ). Since the formula “f : ω → p and p is surjective” is a △0 formula and {f0, ω, p} ⊂H(θ), we have H(θ) l= (f0 : ω →p and p is surjective). So H(θ) l= (∃f)(f : ω →and p is surjective). Since {ω, p} ⊂M we have, M l= (∃f)(f : ω →p and p is surjective). That is, (∃fp ∈M)(fp : ω →p and p is surjective). Pick n ∈ω such that fp(n) = q, and again use the ﬁrst lemma as follows. Since {p, fp, n} ⊂M and (∃!x)(x ∈p and fp(n) = x) is a △0 formula M l= (∃!x)(x ∈p and fp(n) = x). That is, (∃!x)(x ∈p ∩M and fp(n) = x). Since x is unique, x = q and thus q ∈M. Corollary. ω1 ∩M ∈ω1. Proof. It is enough to show that ω1 ∩M is a countable initial segment of ω1. If α ∈ω1 ∩M, then by the above lemma, α ⊆M. Proof of Pressing Down Lemma Let M ≺H(ω2) such that M is countable and f ∈M. Let δ = ω1 ∩M and let β = f(δ) < δ. Then, (∀α < δ)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(x) = β]. 99 So ∀α < δ H(ω2) l= (∃x ∈ω1)(x > α ∧f(x) = β), since everything relevant is in H(ω2). Hence, ∀α < δ M l= (∃x ∈ω1)(x > α ∧f(α) = β) since {α, β, ω1, f} ⊂M. Now, since δ = ω1 ∩M we have, M l= (∀α ∈ω1)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(α) = β]. So H(ω2) l= (∀α ∈ω1)(∃x ∈ω1) [x > α ∧f(α) = β]. Thus we have H(ω2) l= f ←{β} is uncountable. Again, since everything relevant is in H(ω2) we conclude that f ←{β} is uncountable. 2 Proof of the Delta System Lemma Let A be as given. We may, without loss of generosity, let A = {a(α) : α < ω1} where a: ω1 →V. We may also assume that a: ω1 →P(ω1). Let M be countable with {A, ⊣} ⊆M and M ≺H(ω2). Let δ = ω1 ∩M. Let R = a(δ) ∩δ. Since R ⊆M, we know R ∈M by the second lemma. So, ∀α < δ ∃β > α a(β) ∩β = R ⇒H(ω2) l= (∀α < δ)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R] ⇒(∀α < δ) [H(ω2) l= (∃β > α)(a(β) ∩β = R)] ⇒(∀α < δ) [M l= (∃β > α)(a(β) ∩β = R)] ⇒M l= (∀α < ω1)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R] ⇒(∀α < ω1)(∃β > α) [a(β) ∩β = R]. Now recursively deﬁne D: ω1 →A as follows: D(α) = a(0); D(γ) = a(β) 100 CHAPTER 11. ELEMENTARY SUBMODELS where β is the least ordinal such that β > sup {D(γ) : γ < α} and a(β) ∩β = R. Now if γ1 < γ2 < ω1, then D(γ1) ⊆γ2. So, R ⊆D(γ1) ∩D(γ2) ⊆γ2 ∩D(γ2) = R. Thus we let D = {D(α) : α < ω1}. 2 Theorem 49. (Elementary Chain Theorem) Suppose that δ is a limit ordinal and {Mα : α < δ} is a set of elementary submodels of H(θ) such that ∀α ∀α′ (α < α′ < δ →Mα ⊂Mα′). Let Mδ = [ {Mα : α < δ}. Then Mδ ≺H(θ). Proof. Let k ∈ω, let ⃗y ∈ kMδ, and let n ∈ω. We need to show that G(n, H(θ), ⃗y) ∩H(θ) ̸= ∅⇒G(n, H(θ), ⃗y) ∩Mδ ̸= ∅. But this is easy since ⃗y ∈ kMα for some α < δ. Chapter 12 Constructibility The G¨odel closure of a set X is denoted by cl(X) = {X ∩G(n, ⃗y) : n ∈ω and ∃k ∈ω ⃗y ∈ k(X)}. The constructible sets are obtained by ﬁrst deﬁning a function L: ON →V by recursion as follows: L(0) = ∅ L(α + 1) = cl(L(α) ∪{L(α)}) L(δ) = [ {L(α) : α < δ} for a limit ordinal δ We denote by L the class S{L(α) : α ∈ON}. Sets in L are said to be constructible. Lemma. For each ordinal α, L(α) ⊆R(α). Proof. This is proved by induction. L(0) = ∅= R(0) and for each α ∈ON we have, by deﬁnition, L(α + 1) ⊆P(L(α)) ⊆R(α + 1) 101 102 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. 1. ∀X X ⊆cl(X). 2. If X is transitive, then cl(X) is transitive. 3. For each ordinal α, L(α) is transitive. Proof. 1. For any w ∈X, w = G(1,⃗s), where ⃗s(0) = w. 2. Now, if z ∈cl(X) then z ⊆X so z ⊆cl(X). 3. This follows from (1) by induction on ON. Lemma. 1. For all ordinals α < β, L(α) ∈L(β). 2. For all ordinals α < β, L(α) ⊆L(β). Proof. 1. For each α, L(α) ∈L(α + 1) by Part (1) of the previous lemma. We then apply induction on β. 2. This follows from (1) by transitivity of L(β). Lemma. 1. For each ordinal β, β /∈L(β). 2. For each ordinal β, β ∈L(β + 1). 103 Proof. 1. This is proved by induction on β. The case β = 0 is easy. If β = α + 1 then β ∈L(α + 1) would imply that β ⊆L(α) and hence α ∈β ⊆L(α) contradicting the inductive hypothesis. If β is a limit ordinal and β ∈ L(β) then β ∈L(α) for some α ∈β and hence α ∈β ∈L(α), again a contradiction. 2. We employ induction on β. The β = 0 case is given by 0 ∈{0}. We do the sucessor and limit cases uniformly. Assume that ∀α ∈β α ∈L(α + 1). Claim 1. β = L(β) ∩ON. Proof of Claim 1. If α ∈β, then α ∈L(α + 1) ⊆L(β). If α ∈L(β), then α ∈β because otherwise α = β or β ∈α, which contradicts β /∈L(β) from (1). Claim 2. ∀x x ∈ON iﬀ [(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈u v ∈x) ∧(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈x (u ∈v ∨v ∈u ∨u = v)) ∧(∀u ∈x ∀v ∈x ∀w ∈x (u ∈v ∧v ∈w →u ∈w))]. Proof of Claim 2. The statement says that x is an ordinal iﬀx is a tran- sitive set and the ordering ∈on x is transitive and satisﬁes trichotomy. This is true since ∈is automatically well founded. The importance of this claim is that this latter formula, call it Φ(x), is △0 and hence absolute for transitive sets. We have: β = L(β) ∩ON = {x ∈L(β) : x is an ordinal} = {x ∈L(β) : Φ(x)} = {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β+1)(α)} ∈cl(L(β)) using Theorem 44 = L(β + 1). 104 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. 1. For each ordinal β, β = L(β) ∩ON. 2. ON ⊆L. Proof. This is easy from the previous lemmas. Lemma. 1. If W is a ﬁnite subset of X then W ∈cl(X). 2. If W is a ﬁnite subset of L(β) then W ∈L(β + 1). Proof. 1. We apply Theorem 44 to the formula “x = w0 ∨· · · ∨x = wn”, where W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn}. 2. This follows immediately from (1). Lemma. 1. If X is inﬁnite then lcl(X)l = lXl. 2. α ≥ω then lL(α)l = lαl. Proof. 1. By Theorem 44 we can construct an injection cl(X) →ω ×S{kX : k ∈ ω}. Hence, lXl ≤lcl(X)l ≤max (ℵ0, l{kX : k ∈ω}l) = lXl. 105 2. We proceed by induction, beginning with the case α = ω. We ﬁrst note that from the previous lemma, we have L(n) = R(n) for each n ∈ω. Therefore, lL(ω)l = l [ {L(n) : n ∈ω}l = max (ℵ0, sup {lL(n)l : n ∈ω}) = max (ℵ0, sup {lR(n)l : n ∈ω}) = ℵ0. For the successor case, lL(β + 1)l = lL(β)l by (1) = lβl by inductive hypothesis = lβ + 1l since β is inﬁnite . And if δ is a limit ordinal then lL(δ)l = l [ {L(β) : β ∈δ}l = max (lδl, sup {lL(β)l : β ∈δ}) = max (lδl, sup {l(β)l : β ∈δ}) by inductive hypothesis = lδl. Lemma. (∀x) [x ⊆L →(∃y ∈L)(x ⊆y)]. Proof. x ⊆L means that ∀u ∈x ∃α ∈ON x ∈L(α). By the Axiom of Replacement, ∃z z = {α : (∃u ∈x)(α is the least ordinal such that u ∈L(α))}. Let β = sup z; then β ∈ON and for each u ∈x, there is α ≤β such that u ∈L(α) ⊆L(β). Since L(β) ∈L(β + 1) ⊆L, we can take y = L(β). Remark. The above lemma is usually quoted as “L is almost universal”. 106 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Lemma. L l= V = L. Proof. This is not the trivial statement ∀x ∈L x ∈L but rather ∀x ∈L (x ∈L)L which is equivalent to (∀x ∈L)(∃α ∈ON x ∈L(α))L; which is, in tum, since ON ⊆L, equivalent to (∀x ∈L)(∃α ∈ON)(x ∈L(α))L. This latter statement is true since “x ∈L(α)” is a △0 formula when written out in full in LOST, and since L is transitive. For each Axiom Φ of ZFC we have: Theorem 50. Φ L l= Φ. Proof. Transitivity of L automatically gives Equality, Extensionality, Exis- tence and Foundation. We get Inﬁnity since ω ∈L and “z = N” is a △0 formula. For Comprehension, let Φ be any formula of LOST; we wish to prove ∀y ∈L ∀w0 ∈L . . . ∀wn ∈L ∃z ∈L z = {x ∈y : ΦL(x, y, w0, . . . , wn)} since L is transitive. Fix y, w0, . . . , wn and α ∈ON such that {y, ⃗w} ⊆L(α). By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, there is some β > α such that Φ is absolute between L and L(β). By Theorem 44, there is an n ∈ω such that G(n, L(β), y, ⃗w) = {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x, y, ⃗w)}. 107 and so by deﬁnition, {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 1). Now by absoluteness, {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(β)(x)} = {x ∈L(β)ΦL(x)}. So we have {x ∈L(β) : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 1). Moreover, since y ∈L(β + 1), {x ∈y : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} = y ∩{x ∈L(β + 1) : ΦL(x, y, ⃗w)} ∈L(β + 2) and since L(β + 2) ⊆L we are done. For the Power Set Axiom, we must prove that (∀x ∃z z = {y : y ⊆x})L. That is, ∀x ∈L ∃z ∈L z = {y : y ∈L and y ⊆x}. Fix x ∈L; by the Power Set Axiom and the Axiom of Comprehension we get ∃z′ z′ = {y ∈P(x) : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} = {y : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x}. By the previous lemma L is almost universal and z′ ⊆L so ∃z′′ ∈L z′ ⊆z′′. So z′ = z′ ∩z′′ = {y ∈z′′ : y ∈L ∩y ⊆x}. By the fact that the Axiom of Comprehension holds relativised to L we get (∃z z = {y ∈z′′ : y ⊆x})L; i.e., ∃z ∈L z = {y ∈z′′ : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} = {y : y ∈L ∧y ⊆x} The Union Axiom and the Replacement Scheme are treated similarly. To prove (the Axiom of Choice) L, we will show that the Axiom of Choice follows from the other axioms of ZFC with the additional assumption that V = L. It suﬃces to prove that for each α ∈ON there is a β ∈ON and a surjection fα : bα →L(α). 108 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY To do this we deﬁne fα recursively. Of course f0 = β0 = ∅= L(0). If α is a limit ordinal, then we let βα = X {βϵ : ϵ < α} and fα(σ) = fδ(τ) where σ = P{βϵ : ϵ < δ} + τ and τ < βδ. If α = γ + 1 is a successor ordinal, use fγ to generate a well ordering of L(γ) and use this well ordering to generate a lexicographic well ordering of S{k(L(γ)) : k ∈ω} and use this to obtain an ordinal ¯βα and a surjection ¯fγ : ¯βγ → [ {k(L(γ)) : k ∈ω}. Now let βα = βγ+1 = ¯βγ × ω and let fα : βα →L(α) = {G(n, L(α), ⃗y) : n ∈ω and ∃k ∈ω ⃗y ∈k L(γ)} be deﬁned by fα(σ) = G(n, L(γ), ¯fγ(τ)) where σ = ¯βγ × n + τ, τ < ¯βγ. This completes the proof of Theorem 50 Φ and motivates calling “V = L” the Axiom of Constructibility. Remark. V = L is consistent with ZFC in the sense that no ﬁnite subcollec- tion of ZFC can possibly prove V ̸= L; To see this, suppose {Ψ0, . . . , Ψn} ⊢V ̸= L. Then ΨL 0, . . . , ΨL n} ⊢(V ̸= L)L. by Theorem 50. This contradicts the preceding lemma. Remark. Assuming V = L we actually can ﬁnd a formula Ψ(x, y) which gives a well ordering of the universe. We denote by ΦL the conjunction of a ﬁnite number of axioms of ZFC conjoined with “V = L” such that ΦL implies all our lemmas and theorems about ordinals and ensures that x ∈L(α) is equivalent to some △0 formula 109 (but I think we have already deﬁned it to be △0). In particular, x ∈ON will be equivalent to a △0 formula. Furthermore, we explicitly want ΦL to imply that ∀α ∈ON ∃z z = L(α) and that there is no largest ordinal. We shall use the abbreviation o(M) = ON ∩M. Lemma. ∀M(M is transitive and ΦM L →M = L(o(M))). Proof. Let M be transitive such that M l= ΦL. Note that o(M) ∈ON. We have M l= ∀α ∈ON ∃z z = L(α). So, ∀α ∈o(M) M l= ∃z z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) ∃z ∈M M l= z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) ∃z ∈M z = L(α) ⇒∀α ∈o(M) L(α) ∈M ⇒∀α ∈o(M) L(α) ⊆M. Since M l= ΦL, o(M) is a limit ordinal and hence L(o(M)) = [ {L(α) : α ∈o(M)} ⊆M. Now let a ∈M. Since M l= V = L we have M l= ∀x ∃y ∈ON x ∈L(y) ⇒M l= ∃y ∈ON a ∈L(y) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) M l= a ∈L(α) ⇒∃α ∈o(M) a ∈L(α) ⇒a ∈L(o(M)). Lemma. χC If ON ⊆C, C is transitive, and ΦC L, then C = L. 110 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Proof. The proof is similar to that of the previous lemma. Theorem 51. (K. G¨odel) If V = L then GCH holds. Proof. We ﬁrst prove the following: Claim. ∀α ∈ON P(L(α)) ⊆L(α+). Proof of Claim. This is easy for ﬁnite α, since L(n) = R(n) for each n ∈ω. Let’s prove the claim for inﬁnite α ∈ON. Let X ∈P(L(α)); we will show that X ∈L(α+). Let A = L(α) ∪{X}. A is transitive and lAl = lαl. By the Levy Reﬂection Principle, there is a β ∈ON such that both A ⊆L(β) and L(β) l= ΦL, where ΦL is the formula introduced earlier. Now use the Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski Theorem to obtain an elementary submodel K ≺L(β) such that A ⊆K and lKl = lAl = lαl so by elementarily we have K l= ΦL. Now use the Mostowski Collapsing Theorem to get a transitive M such that K ∼= M. Since A is transitive, the isomorphism is the indentity on A and hence A ⊆M. We also get M l= ΦL and lMl = lαl. Now we use the penultimate lemma to infer that M = L(o(M)). Since lMl = lαl we have lo(M)l = lαl so that o(M) < lα+l. Hence A ⊆M = L(o(M)) ⊆L(α+), so that X ∈L(α+). We now see that the GCH follows from the claim. For each cardinal κ we have κ ⊆L(κ) so that lP(κ)l ≤lP(L(κ))l ≤lL(κ+). Since lL(κ+)l = κ+ we have lP(κ)l = κ+. 111 We now tum our attention to whether V = L is true. Let µ be a cardinal and let U be an ultraﬁlter over µ. Recalling that µV = {f : f : µ →V}, let ∼U be a binary relation on µV deﬁned by f ∼U g iﬀ{α ∈µ : f(α) = g(α)} ∈U. It is easy to check that ∼U is an equivalence relation. For each f ∈ µV let ρ(f) be the least element of {α ∈ON : rank(g) = α ∧f ∼U g}. Let [f] = {g ∈R(ρ(f) + 1) : g ∼U f} and let ULTU V = {[f] : f ∈ µV}. Deﬁne a relation ∈U on ULTU V by [f] ∈U [g] iﬀ{α ∈µ : f(α) ∈g(α)} ∈U. It is easy to check that ∈U is well deﬁned. For each cardinal κ, we use the abbreviation [X]<κ = {Y ⊆X : lY l < κ}. Given an uncountable cardinal κ, an ultraﬁlter U is said to be κ−complete if ∀X ∈[U]<κ T X ∈U. An uncountable cardinal κ is said to be measurable whenever there exists a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter over κ. Lemma. If U is a countably complete ultraﬁlter (in particular if U is a µ−complete ultraﬁlter) then ∈U is set-like, extensional and well founded. Proof. To see that ∈U is set-like, just note that {[g] : [g] ∈U [f]} ⊆R(ρ(f) + 2). For extentionality, suppose [f] ̸= [g]; i.e., {α ∈µ : f(α) = g(α)} /∈U. Then either {α ∈µ : ¬f(α) ⊆g(α)} ∈U or {α ∈µ : ¬g(α) ⊆f(α)} ∈U. This leads to two similar cases; we address the ﬁrst. 112 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Pick any h ∈ µV such that h(α) ∈f(α) \ g(α) whenever ¬f(α) ⊆g(α). Then [h] ∈U [f] and [h] ∈U [g]. To see that ∈U is well founded, suppose ∃{fn}n∈ω such that ∀n ∈ω [fn+1] ∈U [fn]. Let A = \ {{α ∈µ : fn+1(α) ∈fn(α)} : n ∈ω} ∈U. A ∈U by the countable completeness of U, so that A ̸= ∅. Pick any β ∈A. Then Fn+1(β) ∈fn(β) for each n ∈ω, which is a contradiction. We now create a Mostowski collapse of ULTU V hU : ULTU V →MU given by the recursion hU([f]) = {hU([g]) : [g] ∈U [f]} As per the Mostowski Theorem, h is an isomorphism and MU is transitive. The natural embedding iU : V →ULTU V is given by iU(x) = [fx] where fx : µ →V such that fx(α) = x for all α ∈µ. This natural embedding iU combines with the unique isomorphism hU to give jU : V →MU given by jU(x) = hU(iU(x)). jU is called the elementary embedding generated by U, since for all for- mulas Φ(v0, . . . , vn) of LOST we have: Lemma. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔ΦMU(jU(v0), . . . , jU(vn)). Proof. This follows from two claims, each proved by induction on the com- plexity of Φ. 113 Claim 1. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn Φ(v0, . . . , vn) ↔¯Φ(iU(v0), . . . , iU(vn)). Claim 2. ∀v0 . . . ∀vn ¯Φ(iU(v0), . . . , iU(vn)) ↔ΦMU(jU(v0), . . . , jU(vn)), where ¯Φ is Φ with ∈replaced by ∈U and all quantiﬁers restricted to ULTU V. We leave the proofs to the reader. Theorem 52. Every measurable cardinal is inaccessible. Proof. We ﬁrst prove that κ is regular. If cf(κ) = λ < κ, then κ is the union of λ sets each smaller than κ. This contradicts the existence of a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter over κ. We now prove that if λ < κ, then lP(λ)l < κ. Suppose not; then there is X ∈[P(λ)]κ and a κ−complete free ultraﬁlter U over X. Now, for each α ∈λ let Aα = {x ∈X : α ∈x} and Bα = {x ∈X : α /∈x}. Let I = {α ∈λ : Aα ∈U} and J = {α ∈λ : Bα ∈U}. Since U is an ultraﬁlter, I ∪J = λ. Since U is κ−complete and λ < κ we have \ {Aα : α ∈I} ∩ \ {Bα : α ∈J} ∈U. But this intersection is equal to X ∪{I}, which is either empty or a singleton, contradicting that U is a free ﬁlter. Lemma. Let U be a µ−complete ultraﬁlter over an measurable cardinal µ. Let M = MU, h = hU, i = iU and j = jU as above. Then for each β ∈ON we have j(β) ∈ON and j(β) ≥β. Furthermore, if β < µ then j(β) = β and j(µ) > µ. Proof. For each β ∈ON we get, by the elementary embedding property of j, that M l= j(β) ∈ON; since M is transitive, j(β) ∈ON. Let β be the least ordinal such that j(β) ∈β. Then M l= j(j(β)) ∈j(β) by elementarity, and j(j(β)) ∈j(β) by transitivity of M. This contradicts the minimality of β. 114 CHAPTER 12. CONSTRUCTIBILITY Now let’s prove that j(β) = β for all β < µ by induction on β. Suppose that j(γ) = γ for all γ < β < µ. We have j(β) = h(i(β)) = {h([g]) : [g] ∈U i(β)} = {h([g]) : [g] ∈U [fβ]} where fβ(α) = β for all α ∈µ = {h([g]) : {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈fβ(α)} ∈U} = {h([g]) : {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈β} ∈U} = {h([g]) : ∃γ ∈β {α ∈µ : g(α) = γ} ∈U} by µ −completeness of U = {h([g]) : ∃γ ∈β [g] = [fγ]} where fγ(α) = γ for all α ∈µ = {h([fγ]) : γ ∈β} = {h(i(γ)) : γ ∈β} = {j(γ) : γ ∈β} = {γ : γ ∈β} by inductive hypothesis Hence j(β) = β. We now show that j(µ) > µ. Let g: µ →ON such that g(α) = α for each α. We will show that β ∈h([g]) for each β ∈µ and that h([g]) ∈j(µ). Let β ∈µ. {α ∈µ : fβ(α) ∈g(α)} = {α ∈µ : β ∈α} = µ \ (β + 1) ∈U Hence [fβ] ∈U [g] and so h([fβ]) ∈h([g]). But since β ∈µ, β = j(β) = h(i(β)) = h([f(β)]) Hence β ∈h([g]). Now, {α ∈µ : g(α) ∈fµ(α)} = {α ∈µ : α ∈µ} = µ ∈U. Hence [g] ∈U [fµ] and so h[g] ∈h([fµ]) = h(i(µ)) = j(µ). 115 Theorem 53. (D. Scott) If V = L then there are no measurable cardinals. Proof. Assume that V = L and that µ is the least measurable cardinal; we derive a contradiction. Let U be a µ−complete ultraﬁlter over µ and consider j = jU and M = MU as above. Since V = L we have ΦL and by elementarity of j we have ΦM L . Note that ΦL is a sentence; i.e., it has no free variables. Since M is transitive, ON ⊆M by the previous lemma. So, by an earlier lemma M = L. So we have L = V l= (µ is the least measurable cardinal) and L = M l= (j(µ) is the least measurable cardinal). Thus L l= j(µ) = µ; i.e., j(µ) = µ, contradicting the previous theorem. Remark. We have demonstrated the existence of an elementary embedding j : V →M. K. Kunen has shown that there is no elementary j : V →V. Large cardinal axioms are often formulated as embedding axioms. For example, κ is said to be supercompact whenever ∀λ ∃j [j : V →M and j(κ) > λ and jlR(λ) = idlR(λ) and λM ⊆M]. 116 CHAPTER 12.
